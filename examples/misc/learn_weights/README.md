# Learn Weights

## How does it work?

 * run_simple is running everything out of the box

  * step by step
       * run: run_training.py
            * A queue is created which holds all combinations.
               * Each combination consists of a complete set of extraction and scoring parameters
            * Each combination is processed once for every sampling='training' document
            * Each combination is removed from the queue and added to the queue_processed once all documents have been processed using the particular combination
        
        * copy the best weights from training_final_result_xxxx.json to run_test.py
            * the same functions as run_training are applied to the training set
        
        * run: evaluate to extract results. They are stored under /result/
          * evaluation_full.json contains the full not parsed result
          * evaluation_only_avg.json contains only the avg distance per document
          * final_result.json full result but parsed
          * final_result_xxxx.json full contains the weights which create the lowest distance for all tested documents


``` delete/rename the files in /queue_caches/ if you want to start over ```
