  "text": "With reports emerging over abnormal green lines appearing on the edges of the latest iPhone -- the first Apple phone to use organic light-emitting displays -- industry watchers are questioning whether the problem is due to the quality of the active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens exclusively supplied by Samsung Display, or Apple\u2019s incapability to adopt and manufacture the advanced-screen phones.\nAccording to the smartphone parts industry, the main cause of the delayed launch of the iPhone X was the \u201cpoorer-than-expected\u201d quality of Samsung\u2019s Super AMOLED panels, and the complaint had been expected earlier in the industry.\n\u201cSamsung had to pay penalties for that,\u201d a source in the display industry told The Korea Herald. \u201cApple had been very picky about the quality of the OLED, while Samsung had no choice other than trying to satisfy its customer.\u201d\nApple has not officially responded on fixing the problem, but the US tech giant is reportedly offering to exchange the faulty phones for new ones, according to foreign news reports.\nA similar problem was found last year when Samsung Electronics released Galaxy S7 smartphones that also used Samsung Display AMOLED screens. At the time, some Galaxy phones showed pink lines on their screens.\nAnother source told The Korea Herald that the yield rate of iPhone X smartphones was \u201csignificantly low\u201d due to the iPhone maker\u2019s inexperience with OLED panels.\n\u201cApple would have encountered unexpected mistakes while assembling those parts for the iPhone X,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey usually add some tuning to the original panels, so it is difficult to clarify where the faulty parts are made.\u201d\nApple reportedly demanded strong confidentiality from parts suppliers about the iPhone X smartphones.\nRead also: Apple suppliers rally on signs of strong iPhone X demand\nSamsung Display remained cautious on the issue, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the set maker\u2019s issue.\u201d\nDetermining whether the green line problem is caused by the hardware or software would be up to the investigation by the phone manufacturer, according to industry watchers.\nIt is the first time for the Korean display supplier to solely provide the proprietary Super AMOLED panels for the world\u2019s most expensive smartphone.\nAccording to market researcher IHS Markit, Samsung\u2019s AMOLED panels are estimated to be $110 per unit, nearly a third of the total cost of the parts, which stands at $370.25.\nDomestic rival LG Display has also developed its own version of AMOLED, named Plastic OLED. AMOLED is a type of OLED display widely used in smartwatches, mobile devices and laptops that provides higher refresh rates than other OLED displays.\nDespite the supply contract with Apple, Samsung Display\u2019s sales ratio of its OLED business division has declined to about 60 percent of its total sales at 8.28 trillion won ($7.39 billion) in the third quarter of this year. It was also less than half of OLED sales in 2015.\nOut of 970 billion won of third-quarter operating profit, the OLED business obtained about 600 billion won.\n\u201cIf not for the penalty issue with Apple, and if the supply volume was not cut down, the OLED business earnings would have been better,\u201d the industry source said.\nAccording to the financial industry, Samsung is expected to provide approximately 60 million OLED panels this year, including the first 15 million units during the third quarter. The initial target volume was 90 million.",
