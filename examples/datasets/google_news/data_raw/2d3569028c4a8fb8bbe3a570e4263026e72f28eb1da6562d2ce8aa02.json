  "text": "When a credit card is lost or stolen\u2014or if the number gets exposed in a data theft\u2014federal law makes it a pretty painless experience for consumers. Credit card holders are on the hook for no more than $50 if any fraudulent charges are made; debit card users have similar caps on losses as long as a problem is reported promptly. The account number is changed, a new card is sent in the mail, and life goes on.\nContrast that with the confusing mess consumers were left to sort out when hackers broke into credit reporting company Equifax Inc. and stole the personal identification information, including Social Security numbers, of almost half the American population. The incident left 145.5 million people facing a lifetime of higher risk for identity theft. Equifax offered free credit monitoring from its own service for a year. But the question of monetary compensation is still up in the air.\nIt\u2019s likely to be worked out in class-action litigation. Because the Equifax breach affected such a huge number of people and compromised some of their most sensitive data\u2014thieves can use Social Security numbers to open accounts in someone\u2019s name\u2014legal experts predict a fierce fight, with plaintiffs likely to demand settlement figures in the billions of dollars. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the biggest breach in history,\u201d says Nathan Taylor, a cybersecurity lawyer with Morrison Foerster in Washington, who represents companies involved in high-profile data breaches.\nIf history is a guide, as Taylor predicts it will be, the final recovery may end up being rather less\u2014perhaps $1 a head once legal fees are paid. Health insurer Anthem Inc. set that benchmark in June when it agreed to pay a record $115 million over a breach that affected 78.8 million people and also compromised Social Security numbers. Even if Equifax were to settle for more than $200 million, with almost twice as many victims as in the Anthem case, that could still be less than the company\u2019s profit for the most recent two quarters. Equifax declined to comment on pending litigation but said it\u2019s focused on helping consumers \u201cto navigate this situation and providing the best customer support possible.\u201d\nSerious settlement talks aren\u2019t likely before both sides have investigated the evidence and tried out some of their legal arguments in court. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are likely to say this breach stands apart from earlier ones. \u201cIf anybody who\u2019s collecting data should have state-of-the-art security practices, it\u2019s these guys,\u201d says Tina Wolfson, an attorney with Ahdoot & Wolfson in Los Angeles who filed two of the 240 consumer class actions against Equifax. When consumer lawyers try to negotiate a deal, however, they may find that a once-promising line of legal attack has been closed to them. The federal law that\u2019s meant to hold companies such as Equifax and its rivals Experian Plc and TransUnion LLC accountable predates the internet and wasn\u2019t created with mass data breaches in mind.\nThe 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act, signed by President Richard Nixon, says credit reporting companies may not furnish consumer data to unauthorized third parties and offers a remedy of as much as $1,000 for every affected consumer. It doesn\u2019t require proof of identity theft or any out-of-pocket losses. In theory, that could be helpful to plaintiffs, because a big hurdle in data breach cases is showing how much consumers were harmed. Although lost data can leave many people at risk and forced to take precautions, it may prove harder to link it to identity thefts.\nBut courts have repeatedly found that the FCRA doesn\u2019t apply to data breaches because of the wording in the statute. That word \u201cfurnish\u201d led a Los Angeles judge in December to dismiss FCRA-based claims against Experian after a 2015 data breach for failing to protect 15 million consumers whose personal information was hacked. \u201cAlthough victims of theft might be the \u2018source\u2019 of the stolen goods, saying that the victims are furnishing their goods to a thief is counterintuitive,\u201d the judge wrote.\nFor Anita Taff-Rice, a California lawyer who specializes in technology and privacy, it\u2019s maddening that companies that were never asked by consumers to gather their data could escape liability for such massive failures under the very law enacted to regulate them. Yet she agrees it\u2019s a stretch to bend the \u201cantiquated language\u201d of the FCRA to fit a world in which hackers prey on the \u201cmodern reality of everything being interconnected by the internet.\u201d\nTaff-Rice says the public would be better off if credit bureaus faced some kind of automatic liability when consumer data fall into the wrong hands. That\u2019s similar to what the Fair Credit Billing Act does in limiting a consumer\u2019s liability for credit card fraud to $50. \u201cIf you have a requirement like this, I believe the credit reporting bureaus will do substantially more to protect your information,\u201d Taff-Rice says. To Francis Creighton, president of the Consumer Data Industry Association, that\u2019s a nonstarter because it singles out the credit bureaus his trade group represents. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a credit bureau problem, it\u2019s a national problem of how we deal with breaches,\u201d he says.\nWolfson, who is also one of the lead lawyers for consumers in the Experian case, notes that the December ruling didn\u2019t bar her clients from pursuing remedies under various state-level cybersecurity statutes and the common law of negligence. (Experian declined to comment on pending litigation.) Wolfson also says that in future cases, a judge may be convinced that FCRA penalties do apply when credit bureaus fail to safeguard information from hackers if the circumstances are egregious enough. \u201cIt\u2019s applying an old law to new facts, but laws are written to adapt to changing times,\u201d she says.\nA decision on whether the FCRA claims can move forward in the Equifax litigation is months away. Taylor doubts a judge will throw them out early in such a big case. \u201cThe company isn\u2019t going to completely avoid litigation because of something that people would characterize as a technicality,\u201d he says. \u2014With Edvard Pettersson",
