  "text": "The \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions scandal scandal has continued to hold back Volkswagen Group, hitting profits despite the carmaker posting strong sales in the third quarter of the year.\nVW reported revenues 5.8pc higher at \u20ac55bn (\u00a348.9bn) in the three months to the end of September. It delivered 2.65m vheicles in the quarter, up 6.3pc.\nOperating profits also came in ahead of expectations at \u20ac1.72bn, compared with the forecast \u20ac1.5bn. However pre-tax profit more than halved to \u20ac1.59bn after the company took a \u20ac2.6bn hit relating to dieselgate.\nIn September 2015 VW admitted that 11m diesel vehicles worldwide had been fitted with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d - software that allowed them to cheat pollution checks.\nThe company has taken tens of billions of costs relating to the scandal, ranging from legal settlements and fines, vehicle buybacks and modifications of affected cars.\nAnnouncing its third-quarter results, VW said provisions relating to buybacks and refits of 2.0-litre diesel cars in the US had been increased as the programme was proving \u201cmore comprehensive and technically more challenging than expected\u201d. The company added that this meant the programme had to be extended.\nFrank Witter, board member for finance, noted that so far this year VW has taken provisions of \u20ac14.5bn relating to dieselgate, adding that \u201cthe diesel issue is nowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts\u201d.",
