  "text": "The U.S. Missile Defense Agency installed the last of 44 inceptors for a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system at Alaska\u2019s Fort Greeley last week amid fears of a missile strike by ordered by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nThe installation was completed as President Donald Trump, who has often responded to Kim\u2019s threats of nuclear missile strikes and war with threats of his own about a potential military conflict, was about to head off on his five-country, 12-day trip to Asia. One of the key components of the trip was finding a way to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile defense programs and its threatening posture.\n\u201cMDA and Boeing emplaced the 44th interceptor in its silo at the Missile Defense Complex at Ft. Greely on Thursday, Nov. 2,\u201d the MDA confirmed to Defense News in a statement.\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\nMore GMD interceptors could be on the way. Military officials reportedly proposed in September another $136 million in funding for fiscal year 2017 to up the total number of interceptors to 64, according to Defense News.\nAlaska officials in August said they were worried about a North Korea missile attack on their state, after Trump and Kim exchanged barbs and threats over the summer. Trump in July said he would unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d like the world had never seen after North Korea carried out one of its missile tests.\nThe totalitarian leader Kim has routinely threatened the U.S. mainland with \u201cfire\u201d and war, but also specifically named the U.S. territory of Guam as a potential target. The threats followed other reports that the North may have developed the capability of placing a miniature nuclear bomb onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It is unclear exactly how many nuclear weapons Pyongyang has developed.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s hiding under the desk that I know of at this point,\u201d Alaska Governor Bill Walker said, according to ABC News. \u201cBut we do have to make sure we have the technology and awareness of what could happen.\u201d\nThe GMD was designed to take out both intermediate and long-range ballistic missiles in space, according to the MDA\u2019s official website. The system uses a combination of sensors called Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle that flip the kinetic energy of an incoming target to destroy it.\nThe system was tested successfully in May, when the U.S. military fired off an \u201cICBM-type missile\u201d from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean and another missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The first-ever \u201clive-fire\u201d test was acclaimed as an \u201cincredible accomplishment,\u201d Reuters reported.",
