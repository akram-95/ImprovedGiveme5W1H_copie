But the Pyongyang\u2019s state media evidently had enough of Trump's insults to the dignity of their \u201csupreme leader.\u201d Buzz60\nIn this undated photo provided on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017, by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sits in a tractor at the Kumsong Tractor Factory, in Nampo, North Korea.

(Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP) ORG XMIT: KNS801 (Photo: AP)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea has gone two months without test firing a missile, the longest such dry spell this year.\nIs it reason for hope?\n\u201cAny answer is speculative,\u201d said Jonathan Pollack, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \u201cThe reasons could be technical. The reasons could be political.\u201d\nThe problem is that that the United States has very little insight into the isolated country and its enigmatic leader, Kim Jong Un.\nU.S. intelligence agencies can peer from the sky and count missiles, tanks and other weapons, at least those that aren\u2019t hidden underground. But reading the intentions of its leadership has proved next to impossible. The country remains under the iron grip of Kim, who apparently is the sole decision-maker about when to launch a missile test.\nAnalysts scrutinize what information they can. North Korea has traditionally fired fewer missiles in the last three months of the year, said Tom Karako, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that is,\u201d he added.\nNorth Korea launched a record number of missile tests this year, raising worries that a miscalculation by the North of the United States about the other country's intentions could lead to war in the region.\nNorth Korea conducted 15 missile tests and detonated a nuclear bomb this year, according to data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The last test was Sept. 14, when North Korea launched an intermediate range missile that flew over Japan and into the northern Pacific.\nThe high number of tests this year have helped North Korea advance its nuclear weapons program. It has also raised tensions with the United States and its allies to one of the highest levels in decades.\nNorth Korea is still conducting tests with rocket engines and conducting other work that suggests it is not slowing its nuclear weapons program, Pollack said.\nThat has raised speculation that the pause in tests could be political. Pollack said Kim may have cooled the tests to see the reaction from President Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to annihilate North Korea if it strikes first.\nThe lull in tests has not been accompanied by a respite in insults and threats the U.S. and North Korean leader have exchanged all year.\n\u201cWhy would Kim Jong Un insult me by calling me \"old,\" when I would NEVER call him \"short and fat?\" Trump tweeted on Saturday. North Korea\u2019s response was quick. A newspaper controlled by North Korea\u2019s ruling party said Trump has been \"sentenced to death\u201d by the Korean people.\nMore: Kim Jong Un is cruel and dangerous but not crazy, North Korean experts say\nMore: From good to bad: 5 possible options for what's next in North Korea-U.S. standoff\nMore: North Korea on Trump's Asia visit: He deserves death\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ildqXu",
