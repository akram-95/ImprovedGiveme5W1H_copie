They would love to do what he does\u201a\u201d Mtetwa said.\n\u201cI look at the leaders in the region as being really more like a trade union of presidents. If you scratch my back\u201a I\u2019ll scratch your back.\u201d\nMtetwa has campaigned for freedom of speech in Zimbabwe\u201a where media freedom is stifled. In 2005\u201a she won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nMtetwa believes the Zimbabwean media has never been free\u201a despite gaining independence.\n\u201cIn Zimbabwe\u201a historically\u201a we have just had this culture of a media that has always been stifled\u201a even by those who claimed to have liberated us.\u201d\nMtetwa said investigative journalism is \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d to democracy because it shines a light on where \u201cpoliticians feed the wolves\u201d.\nShe\u201a however\u201a criticised investigative journalism for focusing too much on politicians and not scrutinising the private sector with the same rigour.\n\u201cIt will help\u201a because the consequences on private players\u201a when we talk about corruption\u201a are far more than those politicians have to face.\u201d",
