  "text": "An Ohio man threatened to kill his wife and carry out mass shootings at a church and a Las Vegas casino that would \u201cgo down in history,\u201d the FBI said Thursday after allegedly uncovering a series of text messages.\nWei Li, 38, was taken into federal custody on Thursday after his estranged wife contacted authorities saying she feared for her life when she received the hostile texts, the FBI said. Li allegedly began texting the woman Nov. 6 and threatened to shoot up the Las Vegas hotel and casino where she worked. The FBI did not specify which hotel Li was planning to target.\n\u201cLi indicated in the text messaging that the killing he planned to commit would go down in history and that he would blame his wife for all the deaths,\u201d the FBI said in a news release.\nLi also allegedly vowed to carry out a mass shooting at a church he attended with at least 1,000 people in it, reportedly writing in a text: \"I will make the biggest [mass shooting] in history,\" according to Cleveland.com. His wife responded to the texts with, \"You are too cruel\" and \"Are you sick?\" court records stated.\nLi also allegedly said he would kill his wife if he didn\u2019t get his green card. Li then sent photos of himself with a rifle, knives and a list of casinos in Las Vegas, Cleveland.com reported. He also reportedly told her he had an automatic rifle.\nCourt records showed Li went to the casino his wife worked at before the Nov. 6 texts and he later told her he was able to roam the building freely.\n\"No one checked me,\" he said.\nCuyahoga Falls police and the FBI approached Li on Nov. 10 and interviewed him. When asked to unlock his phone, Li obliged but then deleted the string of text messages. He initially lied about erasing them, but ultimately admitted to the act and said he believed the messages were \u201cbad,\u201d according to court records. He also claimed he wasn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d about the threats.\nCourt records stated Li had a rifle stolen from him in 2014.\nLi was charged with interstate threatening communications and destruction of evidence. He is expected to make a court appearance on Thursday.\nThe arrest comes after two mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas. A gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 59 people and injuring hundreds more. Twenty-six people were killed when a shooter fired inside a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs on Nov. 5. The pair of incidents were two of the most deadly mass shootings in modern U.S. history.",
