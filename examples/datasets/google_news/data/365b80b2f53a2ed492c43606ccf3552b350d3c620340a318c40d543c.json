  "text": "Star Wars: Battlefront II releases tomorrow, but before the game even made its official debut, it was raising all kinds of havoc, with players complaining about the time \u2013 and money \u2013 it would take to unlock everything via Microtransactions. EA has tried to revamp this system with lower Hero costs and everything, but fans were still up in arms over the effort it would take to earn everything.\nEA, not to see its game dwindle in sales due to these mistakes, decided to own up to them, surprisingly enough. The company recent took to Twitter to announce that it was turning off all in-game purchases entirely, though it did leave the door open to a Crystal-purchasing system returning later on, at an unspecified date.\nOskar Gabrielson, general manager for DICE, addressed the matter, stating, \u201cAs we approach the worldwide launch, it\u2019s clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We\u2019ve heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages. And we\u2019ve heard that this is overshadowing an otherwise great game.\n\u201cThis was never our intention. Sorry we didn\u2019t get this right.\n\u201cWe hear you loud and clear, so we\u2019re turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing and tuning. This means that the option to purchase crystals in the game is snow offline, and all progression will be earned through gameplay. The ability to purchase Crystals in-game will become available at a later date, only after we\u2019ve made changes to the game. We\u2019ll share more details as we work through this.\u201d\nIt sounds like EA has learned its lesson, although the clunky progression system of Need For Speed: Payback, where players have to grind through the game to earn the best cars, remains in place. Hopefully that\u2019ll get fixed too.\nToday, we turned off in-game purchases for #StarWarsBattlefrontII. The game is built on your input, and it will continue to evolve and grow.

Which is exactly how it should be.\nWe\u2019ll note the changes and see how they work with the final product with our Star Wars: Battlefront II review, which posts tomorrow.\nStar Wars: Battlefront II releases tomorrow for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.",
