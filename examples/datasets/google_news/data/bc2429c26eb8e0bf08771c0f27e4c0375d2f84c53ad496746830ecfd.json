  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States agreed on Friday to keep working for a peaceful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis, but a U.S. envoy said it was difficult to gauge the reclusive North\u2019s intentions as there has been \u201cno signal\u201d.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Joseph Yun (R) answers questions from reporters following meeting with Japan and South Korea chief nuclear negotiators to talk about North Korean issues at the Iikura guest house in Tokyo, Japan April 25, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Yamanaka/Pool/File Photo\nNorth Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its nuclear and missile programs, pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, but has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal which it says it needs to counter perceived U.S. aggression.\nLee Do-hoon, South Korea\u2019s special representative for Korean peace and security affairs, and his U.S. counterpart, Joseph Yun, met on the southern resort island of Jeju, following a summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in Seoul last week.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that both of the presidents want to find a peaceful way in regard to North Korea\u2019s nuclear issue,\u201d Yun told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency.\n\u201cSo we discussed them and we agreed the pressure campaign has to be a central element.\u201d\nTrump has said the time for talk is over but he took a softer tone on his trip to Seoul.\nNorth Korea\u2019s last missile test was on Sept. 15 but Lee and Yun did not seem to put much emphasis on the lull, Yonhap said, as they were unable to gauge its intentions.\n\u201cI hope that they will stop forever. But we had no communication from them so I don\u2019t know whether to interpret it positively or not. We have no signal from them,\u201d Yun said.\nLee drew significance from the fact that China, the North\u2019s lone major ally, had sent a special envoy to Pyongyang, saying that South Korea was closely watching what would come out of the visit. The envoy arrived on Friday.\nTrump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races toward its much publicized goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.\nThe United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war. It denies North Korea\u2019s persistent accusation that it is planning to invade.\n(This version of the story was refiled to add \u2018Korea\u2019 to headline)",
