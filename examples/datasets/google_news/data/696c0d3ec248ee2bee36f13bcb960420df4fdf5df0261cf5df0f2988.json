  "text": "North Korea hasn\u2019t fired a missile for 60 days, but that may have more to do with its own winter training cycle than with Pyongyang easing off on provocations.\nSince Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011, only five of the isolated nation\u2019s 85 rocket launches have taken place in the October-December quarter, according to The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies\u2019 North Korea Missile Test Database.\nThe Korean People\u2019s Army regularly enters its training cycle every winter \u201cand getting ready for it involves a calm before the storm,\u201d said Van Jackson, a strategy fellow at the Center for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\u201cFall is the harvest season, and a lot of military labor is dedicated to agricultural output when not in war mode; inefficient, but it\u2019s the nature of the North Korean system,\u201d said Jackson, a former U.S. Department of Defense adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s a routine, recurring pattern, which means we should expect a surge in provocations in the early months next year.\u201d\nNorth Korea\u2019s last launch was on Sept. 15, when the isolated state fired its second missile over Japan in as many months. That missile that flew far enough to put the U.S. territory of Guam in range.\nJoseph Yun, the United States\u2019 top North Korean official, was reported by The Washington Post as saying on Oct. 30 that if the regime halted nuclear and missile testing for about 60 days, it would be the signal Washington needs to resume direct dialogue with Pyongyang. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday denied the U.S. had any such window.\nYun arrived in South Korea on Tuesday, a visit that comes as hopes rise for an easing of tensions on the peninsula in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit and a lull in missile testing.\nYun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, will meet with South Korean and international officials, according to the U.S. State Department, although there is no indication his visit will include talks with the North.\nSeoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Yun is scheduled for talks with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Do-hoon, on Friday on the sidelines of an international conference on disarmament, jointly hosted by the ministry and the United Nations on the resort island of Jeju.\nSouth Korea-born Yun has been at the heart of reported direct diplomacy in recent months with the Kim regime.\nUsing the so-called New York channel, he has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang\u2019s United Nations mission, a senior State Department official said earlier this month.\nEven as Trump called talks a waste of time, Yun has quietly tried to lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear standoff in which each side shows little interest in compromise.\nIn a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations on Oct. 30, Yun reportedly said that if the North halts nuclear and missile tests for about 60 days, it would be a sign that Washington needs to seek a restart of dialogue with Pyongyang.\nSome analysts say it is too early to read much into the break in testing, which is the longest lull so far this year.\nAnd there is no sign that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests as well as Trump\u2019s heated statements.\nDuring his visit to Seoul last week, Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to \u201cmake a deal\u201d to end the nuclear standoff.\nTrump also urged North Korea to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and added that: \u201cI do see some movement,\u201d though he declined to elaborate.\nWhile his comments seemed to reassure many in South Korea, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Trump a \u201cdestroyer of the world peace and stability,\u201d and said his \u201creckless remarks\u201d only made the regime more committed to building up its nuclear force.\nTrump muddied the water later on his Asia visit by Tweeting that North Korean leader Kim had insulted him by calling him \u201cold\u201d and said he would never call Kim \u201cshort and fat.\u201d\nHe also said \u201cit would be very, very nice\u201d if he and Kim became friends.\n\u201cIt is indeed noteworthy that the president, at several junctures, seemed to open the door to negotiations with North Korea,\u201d said David Pressman, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who helped lead North Korea sanctions negotiations as ambassador to the United Nations under former President Barack Obama.\n\u201cHowever, it is entirely unclear if the president\u2019s suggestions are reflective of a strategic shift or merely reflective of what the last person he happened to speak with about North Korea said before the president made those comments.\u201d",
