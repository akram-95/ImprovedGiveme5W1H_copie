The Paparazzi singer - who was a very vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign - was snapped outside Trump Tower following news the businessman had been voted into the White House. She stood outside Donald's building on top of a sanitation truck, wearing all black with the stars and stripes flag tucked into her outfit as she held up a sign that read: \"Love trumps hate\". (Photo: AFP/Getty) As the results were coming in, the Bad Romance singer tweeted: \"In a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America.\" Gaga also shared a video of her star-studded pals at the Javits Center on Tuesday night, with the group including Lena Dunham and Will & Grace star Debra Messing. The Girls star was seen giving a nervous-looking Debra a rub as the nail-biting results were coming in, with Donald Trump looking more likely to beat Hillary to become the 45th President of the United States. \"WE (heart) u HILLARY!! live, from the Javet's Center! #Vote (sic),\" Gaga tweeted with the heart emoji. Hillary is hosting her election party at the venue, which is situated in New York's Hell's Kitchen. (Photo: Twitter/Ladygaga) (Photo: Twitter/Ladygaga) It was reported that some Hillary reporters were already leaving the Javits Center in tears before the final result was revealed. Earlier today, Lady Gaga heaped praise on career politician Hillary Clinton ahead of the US presidential election. As the United States vote to select their next leader, the Poker Face singer has continued to put her support behind the Democrat candidate, and hit out at Donald Trump 's background as a reality star and businessman. \"She kept going and she kept fighting for women's rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children,\" Gaga said.\"She kept fighting for those that are in need. (Photo: Getty) (Photo: Getty) (Photo: Getty) \"And the truth is that Hillary Clinton has done this for her entire career, and now when I say career is that she didn't just wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be president.\" She has been vocal in her support of Hillary , and nailed her colours to the mast again with a scathing put-down of the Republican nominee and his wife Melania Trump. \"@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for \"anti-bullying\" is hypocrisy,\" Gaga wrote on Twitter as she held nothing back. \"Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. (sic)\" He tweet comes days after Melania was speaking at a campaign rally in Philadelphia , and said one of her first goals as first lady was to end cyberbullying. \"Like anything that is powerful, [social media] can have a bad side,\" Melania said. \"Children and teenagers can be fragile. They're hurt when they're made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence. (Photo: Getty) \"This makes their life hard and can force them to hide and retreat. Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers... \"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\" Her husband has been criticised throughout his campaign for comments made about his rival in the presidential race, women, illegal immigrants and other fellow politicians. Gaga later shared another message on Twitter, this time posing in a 'Hillary for President' top. She wrote: \"@realDonaldTrump you divided us with hateful language & fear . I love everyone in this country and I vote for @HillaryClinton to unite us. (sic)\"",
