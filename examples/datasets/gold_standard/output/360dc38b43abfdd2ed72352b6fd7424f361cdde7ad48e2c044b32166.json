There will be two little daughters who will now grow up without their mother. Sadiq Khan gives statement at Croydon tram scene \"She was an amazing mother and definitely a hard-working person. She was on her way to work so early in the morning to provide for her kids.\" Tributes paid on social media to young father Mark Smith, 35, who worked for his father's double glazing firm.

People spilled out on to the streets in a sign of unity as they hugged one another, sang songs and clapped in remembrance of the six men and one woman who died. Family and friends pay tribute to Croydon tram crash victims Many wore red and blue to reflect Crystal Palace football colours after fans Dane Chinnery and Philip Seary were named among the dead. Addressing the mourners one man said: \"I've got a huge hole in my life which I've got to fill in, and it's going to take to the day I die.\" Floral tributes: A bank of bouquets at the scene (PA) Six men and one woman died and more than 50 people were injured when the carriages flipped over as the tram turned around a sharp bend at around 6.10am near the Sandilands stop while travelling from New Addington to Wimbledon. The tram's driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and questioned by investigators who have said the vehicle was travelling \"significantly\" above the permitted speed. The 42-year-old man from Beckenham was released on bail, and investigators are probing whether the driver had fallen asleep. An online fundraising page set up by Croydon Council to enable \"ongoing care and support\" to those directly affected by the crash has raised more then PS8,000.",
