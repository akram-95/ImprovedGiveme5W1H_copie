  "text": "At least two people have died in a suicide attack on the German consulate in a city in north Afghanistan. A car packed with explosives was rammed into the high outer wall surrounding the consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif. Authorities were investigating if a second car was involved, said a local Nato spokesperson. The Taliban called it a \"revenge attack\" for US airstrikes in the volatile province of Kunduz earlier this month that left up to 32 civilians dead. \"The suicide attacker rammed his explosives-laden car into the wall of German consulate in the city,\" local police chief Sayed Kamal Sadat told AFP. A huge explosion, followed by sporadic gunfire, reverberated across the usually tranquil city, smashing windows of nearby shops and leaving terrified local residents fleeing for cover. At least two dead bodies and more than 100 wounded people - including at least 10 children - had so far been brought to two city hospitals, said local doctor Noor Mohammad Fayez. Some of the wounded are in a critical condition, he added. The Nato spokesperson said the attack resulted in heavy damage to parts of the consulate and troops were now on site securing the building and preparing to evacuate its personnel. He said it could not be ruled out that additional explosives were in the area. Helicopters were heard flying over the diplomatic mission early on Friday as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed to the area. The carnage underscores worsening insecurity in Afghanistan as Taliban insurgents ramp up nationwide attacks despite repeated government attempts to jumpstart stalled peace negotiations. German officials in Kabul declined to comment. A diplomatic source in Berlin said Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had convened a crisis meeting at his ministry. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the \"martyrdom attack\" on the German consulate had left \"tens of invaders\" dead. The insurgents are routinely known to exaggerate battlefield claims. Mr Mujahid said the assault was in retaliation for American airstrikes in Kunduz. US forces conceded last week that its air strikes \"very likely\" resulted in civilian casualties in Kunduz, pledging a full investigation into the incident. The strikes killed several children, after a Taliban assault left two American soldiers and three Afghan special forces soldiers dead near Kunduz city, and triggered impassioned protests in the city. Civilian casualties caused by Nato forces have been one of the most contentious issues in the 15-year campaign against the insurgents, prompting strong public and government criticism.
