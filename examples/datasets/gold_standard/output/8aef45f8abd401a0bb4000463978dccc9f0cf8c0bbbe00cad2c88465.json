CELEBRITIES WHO PLEDGED TO LEAVE IF TRUMP WON LENA DUNHAM The Girls star said she'd move to Canada if Trump won the presidency. 'I love Canada. I think that it's a great place, and there's an area in Vancouver that I find beautiful and appealing, and I can conduct business from there,' she said. BARBRA STREISAND Streisand suggested she would move to Australia or Canada if Trump emerged the victor on Election Day. 'I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country if you'll let me in, or Canada,' the singer told 60 Minutes in August. AMY SCHUMER Comedian and actress Amy Schumer said she would head for Spain if Trump won. 'My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere,' she told BBC's Newsnight. 'It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's just too crazy.' SAMUEL L. JACKSON 'If that motherf***** becomes president, I'm moving my black a** to South Africa,' the actor said on Jimmy Kimmel. CHELSEA HANDLER The talk show host revealed she had already bought a house in another county just in case Trump won.

REV AL SHARPTON The civil rights activist told the audience at a Center for American Progress event in February that he would be looking for flights if Trump won.
