At a rally in the Detroit suburbs, Trump repeated his claims that a shadowy conspiracy is working to foil his bid to become president, telling supporters it would have been impossible for the FBI to go through as many as 650,000 emails in a short space of time. EPA 9 Trump is furious after the FBI announced his Democratic rival had no case to answer over her emails AP:Associated Press 9 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gestures as she takes the stage during a campaign rally Sunday \"Right now she's being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system. I've been saying it for a long time,\" he told supporters in Sterling Heights, Michigan. \"Hillary Clinton is guilty, she knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.\" FBI director James Comey revealed that the review did not change the agency's conclusion from July, when it said that no charges were warranted. AP:Associated Press 9 Hillary Clinton takes a selfie with a supporter Getty Images 9 Mason Haliburton, 8, of Omaha, Nebraska, wears campaign buttons that he has collected from five different Trump rallies The announcement came in a letter to congressional lawmakers just days before Election Day. Comey said the FBI has worked \"around the clock to process and review a large number of emails\" obtained from a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. EPA 9 Snuggle, stars and stripes...Trump hugs the American flag He said the review concluded Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information at the State Department. The Democrat's campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri welcomed the move this evening. She told reporters: \"We are glad to see that he has found - as we were confident that he would - that he's confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July. \"And we're glad that this matter is resolved.\" Related stories STERLING CHANCE Donald Trump election win could see the pound given a massive boost... but world economy could suffer about to hit the rocks?

Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton cleared by FBI over email scandal AP:Associated Press 9 FBI director James Comey revealed the latest probe did not change the agency's previous conclusion AP:Associated Press 9 A letter from Comey to Congress revealed Clinton would not face criminal charges Trump made no direct mention of the FBI decision but continued to insist that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. READ MORE: The FBI began investigating the handling of classified material on Clinton's private server in New York shortly after she announced her bid in April 2015. Last July, in an extraordinary public statement on an ongoing case, Comey announced he was not recommending criminal charges against Clinton and called the decision \"not even a close call\". Getty Images 9 Trump lands in Minnesota for a rally moments after Comey's announcement Getty Images 9 Trump told supporters his rival was being protected by a 'rigged system' Donald Trump describes Clinton email probe as 'bigger than Watergate' But he also delivered blistering criticism of Clinton, calling her and her team \"extremely careless\" with their handling of national secrets. Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before the FBI review, but Comey's announcement blunted her momentum. Since then, national polls and battleground states have tightened, though Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign's last moments.",
