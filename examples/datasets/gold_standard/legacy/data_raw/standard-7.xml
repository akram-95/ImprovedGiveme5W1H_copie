Six men and one woman died and more than 50 people were injured when the carriages flipped over as the tram turned around a sharp bend at around 6.10am near the Sandilands stop while travelling from New Addington to Wimbledon.
The tram's driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and questioned by investigators who have said the vehicle was travelling "significantly" above the permitted speed.
