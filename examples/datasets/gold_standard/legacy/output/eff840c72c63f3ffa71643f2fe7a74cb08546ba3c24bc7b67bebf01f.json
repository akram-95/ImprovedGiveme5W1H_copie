But it was later revealed to be \"some type of personal argument\" according to Robert Merner, assistant chief of the Seattle Police Department. \"This individual began to walk away from the crowd then turned and fired into the crowd,\" Merner said. He said the suspect then fled from the area on foot and remained at large at least an hour later. The most seriously injured victim was rushed to nearby hospital where he was said to be a in a critical condition.

Emergency services reached the scene of the shooting within minutes because they were in the area to monitor the demonstrations, according to Merner. The protests in Seattle were one of many across the USA against President-elect Donald Trump which were carrying on through the night across much of the country.
