  "text": "A body language expert has analysed President Barack Obama and Donald Trump's mannerisms during their meeting at the White House. The two men both gave positive feedback about the 90-minute conversation but after years of clashing, it was clear there was some tension between them. Patti Wood, a body language expert, analysed the two men, concluding that Mr Obama was \"resigned and not hopeful\", while Mr Trump was \"serious and perhaps fearful\". \"If you look at the seating position - their lower legs, they are both in the male, alpha position saying 'I am a man',\" Ms Wood told the Daily Mail. Mr Obama had his legs much further apart than Mr Trump's, which Ms Wood claims shows the current President is subconsciously exerting dominance. The hand position of the two men, in particular Mr Trump's, also proved to be interesting. The President-elect was doing the \"downward prayer position\" while sitting beside Mr Obama. \"My read is that he has learned something he didn't know before. It's a tentative hand position,\" Ms Wood said. \"Trump holds his own hands as he begins speaking which is an indication he needs to comfort himself.\" Mr Obama was resting his arms on his legs which apparently indicated he was weary.

As he says it he closes his eyes. I call that an eye block. That tells me he doesn't feel totally encouraged,\" Ms Wood told the Daily Mail. \"Obama was extremely fatigued, resigned and not hopeful but very presidential. Trump was serious and showed indications he heard information that made him fearful.\" Mr Trump took to Twitter after the meeting to quash any rumours of tension between the pair. \"A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!,\" he wrote.",
