Donald Trump has surged in the polls since Comey's Oct. 28 revelation of the new e-mails, many of which were believed to have been sent to or from Clinton's private server while she was secretary of state. The Republican candidate hailed Comey's original letter about the newly found e-mails -- but yesterday, he blasted the FBI chief, saying he did not do a thorough enough probe. \"Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system,\" Trump told a raucous crowd in a suburb of Detroit. \"You can't review 650,000 new e-mails in eight days.

Some contain classified information, but they do not change the total number of classified documents found by the feds, a senior law-enforcement official told NBC. Others hadn't been seen previously by the FBI, but they didn't involve government business, the official said. Authorities seized the computer as part of an investigation into a report that Weiner had engaged in explicit sexual communications with an underage girl. Trump supporters, like their man, blasted Comey's announcement Sunday. \"Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant possibly know,\" tweeted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
