USA TODAY Toblerone chocolate bars come in a variety of sizes, but recently changed the shape of two of its smaller bars sold in the UK. (Photo: Martin Ruetschi, AP) The UK has a chocolate bar crisis on its hands: the beloved Swiss chocolate bar is unrecognizable. Toblerone, the classic chocolate bar with almond-and-honey-filled triangle chunks, recently lost weight. In two sizes, the triangles shrunk, leaving wider gaps of chocolate. Toblerone can you tell me what this is all about... looks like there's half a bar missing! pic.twitter.com/C2VD3DjppE -- Alana Cartwright (@AlanaCartwrigh3) October 29, 2016  @HelenRyles Hi Helen, yes this is just our smaller bar. -- Toblerone (@Toblerone) October 31, 2016  The 400-gram bar was reduced to a 360-gram bar and the 170-gram was reduced to 150 grams. \"Like many other companies, we are experiencing higher costs for numerous ingredients ... we have had to reduce the weight of just two of our bars in the UK,\" the company said on Facebook. People aren't happy about the change. The new #Toblerone. Wrong on so many levels. It now looks like a bicycle stand.#WeWantOurTobleroneBack. pic.twitter.com/C71KeNUWF1 -- James Melville (@JamesMelville) November 8, 2016  So unhappy, in fact, it's outpacing U.S. Election Day news. I'm so happy that readers of BBC News have got their priorities right. #Toblerone#Election2016pic.twitter.com/eeAlvoTqY6 -- David Wriglesworth (@Wriggy) November 8, 2016 It could be the end of the world as we know it. So what are the good folk of Britain talking about? Toblerone. pic.twitter.com/i8ryxmHc5c -- Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) November 8, 2016 Some blame Brexit. Straight up the worst thing about brexit is Toblerone down sizing -- Alex Littlewood (@Alex_JL29) November 8, 2016 #toblerone#brexit I told you that leaving the EU would have serious consequences. Now I' m really upset. pic.twitter.com/w81cWYpNl4 -- Mark Greenwood (@markcjgreenwood) November 8, 2016 The company denies the change is tied to Brexit, a Mondelez spokeswoman told the BBC. The only bars affected are sold in the UK. Follow Ashley May on Twitter: @ashleymaytweets Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fcLZ18",
