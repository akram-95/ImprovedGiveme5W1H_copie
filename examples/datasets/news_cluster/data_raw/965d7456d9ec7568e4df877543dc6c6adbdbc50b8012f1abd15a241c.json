This is why perigee full moons appear about 14 percent bigger, and 30 percent brighter, than its more distant counterpart.\n\u201cThe supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon, not just that once but every chance they have!\u201d said Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center.\nAmateur astronomers don't need any specialized equipment to view the supermoon, however, those looking to document our satellite at its biggest and brightest, should opt for something more sophisticated than a smartphone, astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson says.\nAnd another?\nFor the Super Moon to look big in a picture requires a substantial telephoto lens.
