  "text": "Google Pixel 2\u2019s Pixel Visual Core Now Enhances Photos in Instagram, Snapchat, and WhatsApp\nGoogle is ahead of the game when it comes to camera technologies. The Pixel 2 boasts one of the best (if not the best) cameras of any smartphone released in 2017, and that\u2019s largely thanks to software. We\u2019ve been covering the Android developer community\u2019s efforts to port the Google Camera to other devices, and for phones like the Essential Phone, it\u2019s improved photo quality by leaps and bounds.\nBut be that as it may, the Google Camera app is no substitute for the Pixel 2\u2019s Pixel Visual Core, a custom-designed eight-core chip optimized for image processing. It\u2019s been disabled until now for most users, but this week, Google\u2019s flipping the switch.\nIn a blog post Monday, Ofer Shacham, Google\u2019s engineering manager for the Pixel Visual Core, announced that third-party applications including Instagram, Snapchat, and WhatsApp will be able to make use of the Pixel Visual Core to improve picture quality.\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning on Pixel Visual Core for Pixel 2 users,\u201d wrote Mr. Shacham in a blog post. \u201cUsing computational photography and machine learning [\u2026], Pixel Visual Core improves image quality in apps that take photos. This means it\u2019ll be easier to shoot and share amazing photos on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat, along with many other apps which use the Pixel 2 camera. All you need to do is take the photo and Pixel 2 will do the rest.\u201d\nLeft: Google HDR+ // Right: HDR+ with the Google Pixel Visual Core\nThe Pixel Visual Core, which can crunch a whopping 3 trillion operations per second, accelerates Google\u2019s HDR+ feature, which takes up to 10 identical underexposed shots and averages them together for the best result. As can be seen from the sample photos, there is a pretty noticeable improvement in some cases.\nThe Pixel Visual Core also saves battery by reducing CPU cycles (Google says it consumes 1/10th of the energy of the battery compared to the Pixel 2\u2019s Qualcomm Snapdragon 835) while improving the camera experience with Zero Shutter Lag (ZSL) and digital zoom enhanced with RAISR technologies. What\u2019s more, any app developer can make use of these features.\nGoogle says the Pixel Visual Core update will roll out over the next few days as part of the Pixel 2\u2019s February monthly update, which will also bring new Augmented Reality Stickers themed around winter sports. If you\u2019re an app developer interested in adding support for the Pixel Core, check out Google\u2019s Open Source documentation.",
