The flight, HA446, left Auckland, New Zealand at 12:05 am, January 1st, 2018, and will land in Honolulu, Hawaii at 9:45 am on December 31st, 2017. The incredible time traveling flight was pointed out by the flight tracking website Flightradar24's Twitter account.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nTime travel is possible!\nFlight #HA446 just took off from New Zealand in 2018 and will land in Hawaii back in 2017! pic.twitter.com/3KsCEniCOL \u2014 Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) December 31, 2017\nThis oddity almost didn't happen--the flight was scheduled to leave at 11:55 pm on Sunday, and took off ten minutes late. Perhaps the flight attendants wanted to have their own toast in one time zone before heading to another. In any case, the passengers and crew on the flight will have the rare experience of celebrating New Year's Eve twice in one day. You can track the flight yourself on Flightradar24 here.\nSource: Flightradar24",
