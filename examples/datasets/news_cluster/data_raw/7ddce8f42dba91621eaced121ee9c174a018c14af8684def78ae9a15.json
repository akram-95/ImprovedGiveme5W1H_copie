  "text": "Heading into his Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday night, Justin Timberlake wasn\u2019t having an especially triumphant week. His newest album, \u201cMan of the Woods,\u201d which he teased as a kind of roots-rock survivalist manual , did not collect many accolades upon release. \u201cFame is but wind,\u201d Thomas Coryate wrote, in 1611. Critics, it seemed, were no longer buying Timberlake\u2019s shtick\u2014smooth, hyper-stylized R. & B. that deploys hip-hop production but somehow defangs those elements, makes them idle. \u201cWe are now approaching the 12th year of the national delusion that Justin Timberlake remains an essential pop star,\u201d Jon Caramanica wrote , in the Times . Jamieson Cox, reviewing the album for Pitchfork, called it \u201cwarm, indulgent, inert, and vacuous.\u201d\nOf course, Timberlake has performed at the Super Bowl before, in 2004 , alongside Janet Jackson. During their closing duet, Timberlake arrived at the flip and vainglorious lyric \u201cBet I\u2019ll have you naked / By the end of this song,\u201d and then reached over and snatched off the patch of black leather that was covering Jackson\u2019s right breast. Underneath, Jackson was wearing what appeared to be a metallic, starburst-shaped nipple cover. She clutched her chest. At first, I thought the reveal was plainly choreographed\u2014these are not performers who bungle the finish!\nYet both later said that something had gone wrong. At home and in the stands, people lost their minds. What a baffling and inane fiasco: the F.C.C. received more than five hundred thousand complaints. Refunds were issued. Having been made to grapple with two seconds of partially exposed breast, the nation was subsumed by a wave of puritanical hysteria. (There was no outrage about the several hours of brutal, brain-injury-inducing gameplay that sandwiched it.) They called the incident a \u201cwardrobe malfunction.\u201d The portmanteau \u201cNipplegate\u201d was soon introduced to the lexicon, and took unfortunate hold.\nAfterward, Timberlake was such a louse. Jackson was forced to apologize, which she later said she regretted doing. In 2006, she went on \u201cOprah\u201d to explain herself : \u201cWhy was I apologizing for an accident?\u201d Timberlake, by his own admission, only took about \u201cten per cent\u201d of the heat. Perhaps mainstream culture didn\u2019t yet have the vocabulary to confidently (or competently) discuss the incident and its fallout\u2014to effectively parse its misogyny and its racism. But we do now. Timberlake\u2019s return to the stadium stage seemed like as good a time as any to make amends with Jackson\u2014to invite her to perform, or, even better, to cede as much of the performance as possible to her. Maybe she could pull his pants down and laugh! She deserved it.\nYet on Saturday, in an Instagram post, Jackson quieted the theorizing: \u201cTo put to rest any speculation or rumors as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow; I will not,\u201d she wrote. On Sunday, the hashtag #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay started popping up on social media.\nThen, at some point, a rumor started circulating that Timberlake was going to perform alongside a hologram of Prince, who was a native of Minneapolis, the host city for this year\u2019s game. Prince\u2019s own halftime performance , in 2007, is widely considered the pinnacle of the form. This seemed, from the outset, like a very bad idea. A decade ago, Prince gave an interview to Guitar World in which he expressly decried holograms as \u201cdemonic.\u201d I mean, the language was pretty unequivocal: \u201cThat\u2019s the most demonic thing imaginable. Everything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age,\u201d he said. \u201cThat whole virtual reality thing . . . it really is demonic. And I am not a demon.\u201d\nPrince\u2019s heirs\u2014his sister Tyka Nelson and his five half-siblings\u2014have periodically evaded his wishes, allowing his music to be streamed on Spotify, something he purposefully rebuffed in his lifetime. Earlier in the week, Timberlake held a listening party for \u201cMan of the Woods\u201d at Prince\u2019s Paisley Park estate, in nearby Chanhassen; he served booze, which Prince, a practicing Jehovah\u2019s Witness, had never allowed. The possibility of sacrilege seemed high.\nHeading into the show, I couldn\u2019t see how Timberlake could begin to reverse the vexed and dismissive energy coursing his way\u2014even if he suddenly learned how to read the room, it was likely too late. The public had soured on him, and not without reason. Me, I was only hoping Bob Dylan\u2014another beloved and inimitable Minnesotan\u2014might slowly rise from below the stage, wearing the getup and pencil mustache from his Victoria\u2019s Secret commercial , to duet on \u201c Sexy Back .\u201d\nTimberlake started out in a bunker somewhere deep below the stadium, performing his new single, \u201cFilthy,\u201d to a crowd waving a crop of illuminated mobile devices in the air. This, it turned out, was foreshadowing: in lieu of any proper guests, cell phones would be Timberlake\u2019s co-stars. He danced his way out, and then launched into a breathless and muscular medley of his many hits, beginning with \u201cRock Your Body.\u201d (He abruptly cut himself off before the \u201cI\u2019ll have you naked\u201d bit\u2014which, frankly, felt less like an apology than yet more spineless deflection.) He was wearing a shirt with two deer on it, a faded camouflage suit, and a red neckerchief. It was nice to see him dance again\u2014the video for \u201cFilthy\u201d starred a robot. It seems worth noting that he yelled \u201cMinneapolis!\u201d a lot. During \u201cSuit and Tie,\u201d which he performed on a little platform, he did some nice microphone-stand work\u2014not James Brown calibre, but nonetheless jazzy. \u201cLet me see you put your cell phones up, Minneapolis! Let\u2019s light it up tonight,\u201d he hollered, in what might be the bleakest stage banter I have ever heard.\nWhen I realized that his backing band was wearing a deep purple, I knew to be concerned. Then Prince appeared\u2014or, rather, a massive projection of Prince, on a screen behind Timberlake, who was, by now, seated at a white grand piano. Is it wrong to call what happened next a duet? It feels wrong. I\u2019ll say only that Timberlake intercut his own vocals with Prince performing \u201cI Would Die 4 U,\u201d and we all died 4 him. Minneapolis lit up in purple lights.\nI thought that Timberlake might finish with \u201cMirrors,\u201d a ballad about how we sometimes complete one another\u2014one of his best and most dynamic songs, a tender devotional. But there was no escaping \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!,\u201d the psychotically chipper single he wrote for the film \u201cTrolls.\u201d As dancers flooded the field, Timberlake eventually made his way into the stands. He cajoled a child into filming a cell-phone video with him. Many more phones turned in his direction. For someone so aware of the way news travels now, his performance was oddly benign\u2014expert, sure (in his decades of pop stardom, Timberlake has never been anything less than expert), but eerily un-self-aware. In 2018, eyeballs do not necessarily equal adulation. It seems fitting that the last thing Timberlake said, before sprinting away, his forehead glinting, was \u201cSuper Bowl selfies!\u201d In the end, that was all that mattered.",
