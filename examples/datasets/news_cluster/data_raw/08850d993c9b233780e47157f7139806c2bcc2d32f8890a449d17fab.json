  "text": "Photo\nHe was a high-stakes gambler recognized in the casinos of Nevada. He dabbled in real estate investments in Texas. His last known full-time employment was 30 years ago. He was twice divorced. He had a pilot\u2019s license and had owned two single-engine planes.\nWhile his motive for the mass shooting outside a Las Vegas casino on Sunday night is unknown, details of Stephen Paddock\u2019s history pointed to an unmoored and highly unconventional life.\nFrom his neighbors in a quiet retirement community in Mesquite, Nev., he drew little attention, unless it was for his extreme propensity to keep to himself. He displayed no strong religious or political views, his relatives said, and was not known for angry outbursts.\nBut he was the son of a bank robber who ultimately escaped from prison and spent most of the 1970s on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list. His girlfriend, sought for questioning by law enforcement officials after the shooting, had passed through Tokyo, officials said.\nDetails about Mr. Paddock\u2019s career and livelihood were sparse, aside from observations by neighbors and family members that he routinely gambled large amounts of money. \u201cHe was a gambler, that was his job,\u201d his brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters Monday at his home in Orlando. \u201cHe was a wealthy guy, playing video poker, who went cruising all the time and lived in a hotel room.\u201d\nPhoto\nMr. Paddock and his three brothers were raised by their mother, who told the children that their father had died when in fact he was in prison, Eric Paddock said. Mr. Paddock\u2019s father was convicted in 1961 of committing a series of bank robberies, and was sentenced to 20 years, but escaped from La Tuna federal prison in Texas in 1968 and then became a used-car dealer and bingo parlor operator in Oregon.\nA \u201cWanted\u201d poster for the elder Mr. Paddock warned that he was \u201cdiagnosed as psychopathic,\u201d \u201creportedly has suicidal tendencies\u201d and \u201cshould be considered armed and very dangerous.\u201d\nThe children\u2019s mother was left to raise the family on her own. They moved around the country, from Iowa to Tucson to Southern California, another brother, Patrick Paddock II, of Tucson, said. Stephen Paddock\u2019s behavior did not offer any indication of violent tendencies, the brother said.\n\u201cHe was the least violent in the family during my childhood. So, it\u2019s kind of like, \u2018Who?\u2019 \u201d Comparing himself to his brother, he said, \u201cI have much more anger.\u201d\nStephen Paddock attended college, his family said, and worked for a predecessor company to Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contracting company, from 1985 to 1988. Lockheed Martin confirmed his employment but did not identify the company for which Mr. Paddock worked.\nMr. Paddock once owned and managed a working-class apartment complex in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, Tex., records show.\nA resident, Priscilla McBride, told The Dallas Morning News that Mr. Paddock often roamed the apartment property, casually talking to residents.\nHe moved away several years ago, she said, and they had not seen each other since. \u201cI thought, it couldn\u2019t be,\u201d she said of the mass shooting. \u201cYou would have never thought he would be killing people. You just never know.\u201d\nMr. Paddock bought three guns \u2014 a handgun and two rifles \u2014 at a shop in Mesquite, Guns & Guitars, within the last year, said Christopher Sullivan, the general manager. All the purchases were legal and cleared routine federal screening, Mr. Sullivan said.\n\u201cThe man does not have a criminal history,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\nTwo of the gunman\u2019s three brothers said they were not close, and the third could not be located. Patrick Paddock said he and his brother had not been in contact for as long as 20 years, and he did not initially recognize the face that flashed on his television screen. He wondered aloud about the motive behind the crime, and expressed profound distress for the victims.\n\u201cMy anxiety is not a drop in the ocean compared to how I feel about the people who got killed,\u201d he said.\nEric Paddock broke down in tears during an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say. My brother did this. It\u2019s like he shot us. I couldn\u2019t be more dumbfounded,\u201d he said. He said he last communicated with his brother when Stephen inquired about how the family had fared during Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida in September.\nPhoto\n\u201cHe texted me to ask about my mom after the hurricane,\u201d Eric Paddock told reporters. \u201cHe sent her a walker.\u201d\nHe said the situation has been very difficult for their 89-year-old mother, who \u201chad to deal with her husband who was a bank robber, and now this.\u201d\nEric Paddock said that his brother was a wealthy man who gambled for fun. The two brothers had shared a real estate business for decades, refurbishing properties, the sale of which had left his brother with what he estimated was $2 million. \u201cHe\u2019s a multimillionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cHe helped me become affluent, he made me wealthy.\u201d\nStephen Paddock, 64, lived with his current girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62.\nShe worked as a \u201chigh-limit hostess\u201d at the Atlantis Casino in Reno, Nev. from 2010 to 2013, according to her LinkedIn account. On Monday, the casino said that she left the company several years ago. High-limit hostesses attend to members of a loyalty club called Club Paradise who spend large quantities of money and receive discounted hotel rooms, meals and other amenities, according to the casino\u2019s website.\nMr. Paddock seemed to have no criminal history, according to records searches in places where he was known to have lived. The Mesquite Police Department said they had no interactions with the couple, including traffic stops.\nFew things seemed out of the ordinary Thursday when Mr. Paddock checked into a suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

More than 500 others were injured.\nWhen police stormed his room shortly before midnight, Mr. Paddock lay dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He left behind 23 guns in the hotel suite, including two rifles mounted on tripods, 19 guns in his house, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, broken windows, and a trail of questions by family members and neighbors who are struggling to make sense of his motive. His car remained parked with the hotel valet.\nSheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department described Mr. Paddock as a \u201clone wolf\u201d whose intentions had gone unnoticed by hotel staff members who had gone in and out of his room without detecting the trove of weapons.\n\u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,\u201d Sheriff Lombardo said.\nOn Monday, local police had blocked off the entrance to Sun City, the retirement community where Mr. Paddock lived.\nEric Paddock said he and his family were \u201cshocked, horrified\u201d by the news, saying he was \u201cnot an avid gun guy.\u201d The brother told CBS News that he knew Mr. Paddock had handguns, but that as far as he knew, Mr. Paddock did not own machine guns.\n\u201cWhere the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that,\u201d the brother said. \u201cWhen you find out about him, like I said, he\u2019s a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite and drove down and gambled in Las Vegas.\u201d\nPhoto\nEric Paddock told reporters in Florida that his brother \u201chad nothing to do with any political organization, religious organization, no white supremacist, nothing, as far as I know. And I\u2019ve only known him for 57 years.\u201d\nMr. Paddock had a private pilot\u2019s license, according to Federal Aviation Administration, and had two small planes registered in his name.\nOne of Mr. Paddock\u2019s ex-wives, who now lives near Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles police that they had divorced 27 years ago after being married six years. They had no children.\nHe owned several homes and properties across the country, according to a review of public records.\n\u201cHe seemed normal, other than that he lived by gambling,\u201d Sharon Judy, a former neighbor, told Florida Today. \u201cHe was very open about that. First time we ever met him, he handed us the key to the house and said, \u2018Hey, would you keep an eye on the house, we\u2019re only going to be here every now and then.\u2019 \u201d\nHe was a regular at the Eureka Casino Resort in Mesquite, where on Monday the slot machines jangled, the waitresses circled and gamblers folded hundred dollar bills into the hands of eager bookies.\nSeveral people said Mr. Paddock played video poker and card games and had recently won a $20,000 jackpot, a celebrated event at the casino.\n\u201cThat was his spirit,\u201d said Doug Reath, a Mesquite resident who works in real estate. \u201cHe would come here and play.\u201d",
