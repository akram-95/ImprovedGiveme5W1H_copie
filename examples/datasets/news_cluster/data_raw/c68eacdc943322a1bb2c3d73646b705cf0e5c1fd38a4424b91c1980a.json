  "text": "File - In this Thursday, Dec. 28, 2017 file photo, Ahed Tamimi is brought to a courtroom inside Ofer military prison near Jerusalem. Tamimi, 16, from the village of Nebi Saleh on Monday for attacking the soldiers as well as for previous altercations. It extended her remand for 8 days. (Mahmoud Illean, File/Associated Press)\nRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 Israel\u2019s military says a teenage Palestinian girl could face up to 14 years in prison after being indicted for allegedly assaulting a pair of Israeli soldiers outside her home.\nAhed Tamimi, 16, was charged this week by an Israeli military court after she was filmed in December pushing, kicking and slapping the soldiers, who stood by silently. Her father said the girl was upset after her 15-year-old cousin was shot in the head with a rubber bullet.\nThe widely shared video turned Tamimi into a Palestinian hero. In Israel, the footage sparked debate about the soldiers\u2019 refusal to act.\nThe maximum sentence appears unlikely.\nHer lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said Wednesday she doubts such a sentence is likely. She said sentencing for such an offense is usually \u201cmuch, much lighter.\u201d\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
