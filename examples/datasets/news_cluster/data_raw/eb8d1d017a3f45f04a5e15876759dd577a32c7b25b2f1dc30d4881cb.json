  "text": "(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd made a $121 billion \u201cbest and final offer\u201d on Monday to acquire Qualcomm Inc, ratcheting up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in talks on what would be the biggest ever technology acquisition.\nThe takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.\nQualcomm responded that its board of directors would review the latest offer, and declined to comment further until then.\nBroadcom\u2019s new $82 per share offer included $60 in cash and $22 in Broadcom stock. Its first offer, of $70 per share, in November comprised $60 in cash and $10 in stock. The increased stock component would subject the deal to a Broadcom shareholder vote.\nReuters first reported on Broadcom\u2019s new offer on Sunday.\nQualcomm shares fell 4.3 percent to $63.20 at mid-afternoon on doubts about the deal\u2019s prospects, as well a KGI Securities report that said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel Corp to supply modem chips for its next-generation iPhones.\nBroadcom shares edged up 0.2 percent to $235.77.\n\u201cQualcomm and its board now have a tough decision, as this is a compelling offer in our opinion,\u201d said analyst Daniel Ives of GBH Insights.\nSingapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.\nQualcomm is locked in a patent dispute with Apple over its licensing agreements.\n\u201cQualcomm got where it did in the last 30 years with a business model hinging on intellectual property licensing that is, at this day and age, not sustainable. You can sell products, as Broadcom does, very successfully, and generate a very good return for your shareholders,\u201d Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in an interview.\nA sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake\nIn a presentation issued on its website, Broadcom criticized Qualcomm\u2019s management team, led by its CEO Steve Mollenkopf, for its total shareholder returns of negative 7 percent since 2005, while the wider semiconductor index has returned 106 percent.\nIn January, Qualcomm announced an ambitious 2019 profit target predicated on a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and resolving licensing disputes, including with Apple. Broadcom said there was no reason to believe Qualcomm\u2019s latest initiative would be successful.\nBroadcom also announced concessions to address Qualcomm\u2019s concerns that their combination could take more than 18 months to secure regulatory approval, and that divestitures demanded by antitrust watchdogs could be financially burdensome.\nBroadcom said it was willing pay Qualcomm a \u201cticking fee\u201d if the transaction is not completed within its target of 12 months after any definitive agreement. It would also pay a significant \u201creverse termination fee\u201d if regulators scuttle the deal.\nBroadcom\u2019s antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.\n\u201cThere is no antitrust issue. The overlap is very limited in this transaction. People talk about us making even more commitments on the regulatory front, like adding hell-or-high water provisions, which are not a very well defined legal standard, and we chose not to include it because it would not add much incremental certainty,\u201d said Tan.\nQUALCOMM\u2018S DEAL WITH NXP\nBroadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV on the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated.\nNXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares were trading at $119.16 on Monday afternoon, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal.\nQualcomm\u2019s proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China\u2019s blessing later this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer.\nAt Qualcomm\u2019s March 6 shareholder meeting, Broadcom plans to nominate a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board. That remains the company\u2019s focus unless Qualcomm agrees to negotiate, Tan said. When asked, he did not exclude the option of launching a direct offer for Qualcomm shares.\n\u201cWe are going all the way to Qualcomm\u2019s shareholder meeting of March 6,\u201d Tan said.",
