  "text": "Like an astronomical action movie, January is packed with planetary conjunctions, two \u00adsupermoons with the second one blue, a lunar eclipse, meteors and increasing sunlight.\nThe new year\u2019s night sky starts with a full moon on Monday that rises at 4:52 p.m. and officially becomes full at 9:24 p.m., according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. Since the moon is at perigee \u2014 its closest point to Earth in the lunar cycle \u2014 it appears closer and people call it a supermoon. This is the closest perigee for 2018.\nAs a bonus, the lunar cycle brings a second full moon Jan. 31 at 8:27 a.m. In folk terms, the second one is nicknamed a blue moon. It\u2019s also a full moon close to perigee (Jan. 30), making it another supermoon.\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s more about this moon: The western United States also will enjoy an early morning total lunar eclipse on Jan. 31. The Eastern states won\u2019t see much as they catch only the penumbral and partial phase before the moon sets (Washington moonset is 7:15 a.m., concurrent with sunrise.) States in the Mountain (6:30 a.m., mid-eclipse) and Pacific (5:30 a.m., mid-eclipse) time zones can witness the copper-toned totality.\nJupiter and Mars loiter together in the morning heavens. Early risers can see both planets high in the southeastern sky before sunrise. The giant Jupiter, at -1.8 magnitude (bright) now, and our red neighbor Mars, at 1.5 magnitude (dim), huddle close for their pre-dawn conjunction on Saturday and Jan. 7. They remain close for a few days, then slowly break apart, and the waning crescent moon joins the pair Jan. 11.\nCloser to the horizon, the fleet Mercury (-0.3 magnitude, bright) and the ringed Saturn (0.5 magnitude, dimmer) conjunct just above the treetops before dawn in the southeast on Jan. 13.\nVenus can\u2019t be seen, as the planet hides in the sun\u2019s glare for January and into February. Earth\u2019s charming neighbor effectively returns in March.\nThe Quadrantid meteors peak on Wednesday night into Thursday, and this cosmic show usually features a strong 120 meteors each hour during a short peak, according to the American Meteor Society. But because of the bright, waning gibbous moon, sky gazers face a virtual wipeout and will be lucky to see a few shooting stars.\nEarth gets closest to the sun \u2014 an event called perihelion \u2014 on Wednesday at 12:35 a.m. Eastern time, the Naval Observatory said. On our blue planet\u2019s annual tour around the sun, we will be a mere 91.4 million miles from it. So, why must we endure cold?\nEarth\u2019s Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, creating winter. Earth reaches aphelion (farthest from the sun) in July.\nGood news: The Northern Hemisphere gradually emerges from winter\u2019s darkness. On New Year\u2019s Day, Washington collects nine hours and 30 minutes of daylight, but on Jan. 31, the city luxuriates in 10 hours and 13 minutes of light, according to the observatory.\nDown-to-Earth events:\n\u25cfFriday \u2014 The Analemma Society holds public sky viewing every Friday at its roll-top observatory, Turner Farm Park in Great Falls. 7:30 p.m. Other dates: Jan. 12, 19 and 26.
