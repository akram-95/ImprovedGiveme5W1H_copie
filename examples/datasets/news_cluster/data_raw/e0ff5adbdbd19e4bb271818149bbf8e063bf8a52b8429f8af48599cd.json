His shunt brought out the safety car, but when the race re-started it was Raikkonen's turn to fall foul of the conditions.\nRaikkonen slammed into the nearside barrier before his car slid across the track and collided with the opposing wall. Raikkonen sat there helplessly as cars came within feet of hitting his stationary Ferrari.\n\"This is just mad,\" said a furious Sebastian Vettel, who also spun earlier in the race, over the team radio. \"Stupid. What this race needs is a red flag. How many people do we want to crash?\"\nThe race was instantly suspended with Hamilton ahead of Rosberg and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in the order.\n(Image: Reuters)\n(Image: GETTY)\nEarlier, Frenchman Romain Grosjean also crashed on his way to the grid.\nRosberg, 19 points clear of Hamilton in the title race, will seal the championship if he wins here.\nThe race re-started but was set for another lengthy delay on lap 28, before the race again got going again behind the safety car.\nFelipe Massa was the last driver to end their day against the wall, sadly crashing in his final home country race.\nHe left the track in tears as the crowd went wild for their star Williams driver in spite of his lap 48 exit.\nMassa's final F1 race will be in a fortnight in Abu Dhabi and after the finish in Sao Paula said: \"I will never forget this day.\"\nHamilton mastered the conditions once the final safety car had departed and paved way for some feverish racing.\nHe took the win and kept the driver's championship alive while rival Nico Rosberg, whose lead was cut to 12 points ahead of the UAE race, finished second and Max Verstappen produced a barnstorming drive for third.",
