  "text": "\u201cI must say that he surprised me,\u201d said father, Jos, who competed in Formula One from 1994 to 2003. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many races of this, and this was incredible. Although Red Bull didn\u2019t have the right strategy and were unlucky with the weather, it was almost worth them having a bad stop to see what he did afterwards. It\u2019s good for F1, everyone is enthusiastic. What more do you want?\u201d\nEqually enraptured was Niki Lauda, the former world champion and Mercedes\u2019 non-executive chairman. Congratulating the Verstappen family, he said: \u201cMax was outstanding with the passes he performed. He did a job that was impressive. I knew the guy was good, but he has proved again to everybody what he can do.\u201d",
