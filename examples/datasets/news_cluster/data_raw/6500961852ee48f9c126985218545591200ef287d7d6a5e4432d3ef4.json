  "text": "\u201cPulp Fiction\u201d made Weinstein rich and respected, and Thurman says he introduced her to President Barack Obama at a fund-raiser as the reason he had his house.\n\u201cThe complicated feeling I have about Harvey is how bad I feel about all the women that were attacked after I was,\u201d she told me one recent night, looking anguished in her elegant apartment in River House on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, as she vaped tobacco, sipped white wine and fed empty pizza boxes into the fireplace.\n\u201cI am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did. Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of \u2018Kill Bill,\u2019 a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.\u201d\nThurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein\u2019s predatory behavior. It has since issued a public apology. \u201cI stand as both a person who was subjected to it and a person who was then also part of the cloud cover, so that\u2019s a super weird split to have,\u201d she says.\nShe talks mordantly about \u201cthe power from \u2018Pulp,\u2019\u201d and reminds me that it\u2019s in the Library of Congress, part of the American narrative.\nPhoto\nWhen asked about the scandal on the red carpet at the October premiere for her Broadway play, \u201cThe Parisian Woman,\u201d an intrigue about a glamorous woman in President Trump\u2019s Washington written by \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d creator Beau Willimon, she looked steely and said she was waiting to feel less angry before she talked about it.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cI used the word \u2018anger\u2019 but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,\u201d she says now. \u201cI was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.\u201d\nBy Thanksgiving, Thurman had begun to unsheathe her Hattori Hanzo, Instagramming a screen shot of her \u201croaring rampage of revenge\u201d monologue and wishing everyone a happy holiday, \u201c(Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators \u2014 I\u2019m glad it\u2019s going slowly \u2014 you don\u2019t deserve a bullet) \u2014 stay tuned.\u201d\nStretching out her lanky frame on a brown velvet couch in front of the fire, Thurman tells her story, with occasional interruptions from her 5-year-old daughter with her ex, financier Arpad Busson. Luna is in her pj\u2019s, munching on a raw cucumber. Her two older kids with Ethan Hawke, Maya, an actress, and Levon, a high school student, also drop by.\nIn interviews over the years, Thurman has offered a Zen outlook \u2014 even when talking about her painful breakup from Hawke. (She had a brief first marriage to Gary Oldman.) Her hall features a large golden Buddha from her parents in Woodstock; her father, Robert Thurman, is a Buddhist professor of Indo-Tibetan studies at Columbia who thinks Uma is a reincarnated goddess.\nBut beneath that reserve and golden aura, she has learned to be a street fighter.\nShe says when she was 16, living in a studio apartment in Manhattan and starting her movie career, she went to a club one winter night and met an actor, nearly 20 years older, who coerced her afterward when they went to his Greenwich Village brownstone for a nightcap.\n\u201cI was ultimately compliant,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.\u201d\nThurman got to know Weinstein and his first wife, Eve, in the afterglow of \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d \u201cI knew him pretty well before he attacked me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me.\u201d\nThings soon went off-kilter in a meeting in his Paris hotel room. \u201cIt went right over my head,\u201d she says. They were arguing about a script when the bathrobe came out.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel threatened,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought he was being super idiosyncratic, like this was your kooky, eccentric uncle.\u201d\nHe told her to follow him down a hall \u2014 there were always, she says, \u201cvestibules within corridors within chambers\u201d \u2014 so they could keep talking. \u201cThen I followed him through a door and it was a steam room. And I was standing there in my full black leather outfit \u2014 boots, pants, jacket. And it was so hot and I said, \u2018This is ridiculous, what are you doing?\u2019 And he was getting very flustered and mad and he jumped up and ran out.\u201d\nThe first \u201cattack,\u201d she says, came not long after in Weinstein\u2019s suite at the Savoy Hotel in London. \u201cIt was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn\u2019t actually put his back into it and force me. You\u2019re like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track.\u201d\nShe was staying in Fulham with her friend, Ilona Herman, Robert De Niro\u2019s longtime makeup artist, who later worked with Thurman on \u201cKill Bill.\u201d\n\u201cThe next day to her house arrived a 26-inch-wide vulgar bunch of roses,\u201d Thurman says. \u201cThey were yellow. And I opened the note like it was a soiled diaper and it just said, \u2018You have great instincts.\u2019\u201d Then, she says, Weinstein\u2019s assistants started calling again to talk about projects.\nShe thought she could confront him and clear it up, but she took Herman with her and asked Weinstein to meet her in the Savoy bar. The assistants had their own special choreography to lure actresses into the spider\u2019s web and they pressured Thurman, putting Weinstein on the phone to again say it was a misunderstanding and \u201cwe have so many projects together.\u201d Finally she agreed to go upstairs, while Herman waited on a settee outside the elevators.\nOnce the assistants vanished, Thurman says, she warned Weinstein, \u201cIf you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.\u201d Her memory of the incident abruptly stops there.\nThrough a representative, Weinstein, who is in therapy in Arizona, agreed that \u201cshe very well could have said this.\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nDownstairs, Herman was getting nervous. \u201cIt seemed to take forever,\u201d the friend told me. Finally, the elevator doors opened and Thurman walked out. \u201cShe was very disheveled and so upset and had this blank look,\u201d Herman recalled. \u201cHer eyes were crazy and she was totally out of control. I shoveled her into the taxi and we went home to my house. She was really shaking.\u201d Herman said that when the actress was able to talk again, she revealed that Weinstein had threatened to derail her career.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The #MeToo Moment A newsletter offering the latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.

One top Hollywood executive who knew them both said the work relationship continued but that basically, \u201cShe didn\u2019t give him the time of day.\u201d\nThurman says that she could tolerate the mogul in supervised environments and that she assumed she had \u201caged out of the window of his assault range.\u201d\nShe attended the party he had in SoHo in September for Tarantino\u2019s engagement to Daniella Pick, an Israeli singer. In response to queries about Thurman\u2019s revelations, Weinstein sent along six pictures of chummy photos of the two of them at premieres and parties over the years.\nAnd that brings us to \u201cthe Quentin of it all,\u201d as Thurman calls it. The animosity between Weinstein and Thurman infected her creative partnership with Tarantino.\nMarried to Hawke and with a baby daughter and a son on the way, Thurman went to the Cannes Film Festival in 2001. She says Tarantino noticed after a dinner that she was skittish around Weinstein, which was a problem, since they were all about to make \u201cKill Bill.\u201d She says she reminded Tarantino that she had already told him about the Savoy incident, but \u201che probably dismissed it like \u2018Oh, poor Harvey, trying to get girls he can\u2019t have,\u2019 whatever he told himself, who knows?\u201d But she reminded him again and \u201cthe penny dropped for him. He confronted Harvey.\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nLater, by the pool under the Cypress trees at the luxurious Hotel du Cap, Thurman recalls, Weinstein said he was hurt and surprised by her accusations. She then firmly reiterated what happened in London. \u201cAt some point, his eyes changed and he went from aggressive to ashamed,\u201d she says, and he offered her an apology with many of the sentiments he would trot out about 16 years later when the walls caved in.\n\u201cI just walked away stunned, like \u2018O.K., well there\u2019s my half-assed apology,\u2019\u201d Thurman says.\nWeinstein confirmed Friday that he apologized, an unusual admission from him, which spurred Thurman to wryly note, \u201cHis therapy must be working.\u201d\nSince the revelations about Weinstein became public last fall, Thurman has been reliving her encounters with him \u2014 and a gruesome episode on location for \u201cKill Bill\u201d in Mexico made her feel as blindsided as the bride and as determined to get her due, no matter how long it took.\nWith four days left, after nine months of shooting the sadistic saga, Thurman was asked to do something that made her draw the line.\nIn the famous scene where she\u2019s driving the blue convertible to kill Bill \u2014 the same one she put on Instagram on Thanksgiving \u2014 she was asked to do the driving herself.\nBut she had been led to believe by a teamster, she says, that the car, which had been reconfigured from a stick shift to an automatic, might not be working that well.\nShe says she insisted that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable operating the car and would prefer a stunt person to do it. Producers say they do not recall her objecting.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cQuentin came in my trailer and didn\u2019t like to hear no, like any director,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was furious because I\u2019d cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. He said: \u2018I promise you the car is fine. It\u2019s a straight piece of road.\u2019\u201d He persuaded her to do it, and instructed: \u201c \u2018Hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won\u2019t blow the right way and I\u2019ll make you do it again.\u2019 But that was a deathbox that I was in. The seat wasn\u2019t screwed down properly. It was a sand road and it was not a straight road.\u201d (Tarantino did not respond to requests for comment.)\nThurman then shows me the footage that she says has taken her 15 years to get. \u201cSolving my own Nancy Drew mystery,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s from the point of view of a camera mounted to the back of the Karmann Ghia. It\u2019s frightening to watch Thurman wrestle with the car, as it drifts off the road and smashes into a palm tree, her contorted torso heaving helplessly until crew members appear in the frame to pull her out of the wreckage. Tarantino leans in and Thurman flashes a relieved smile when she realizes that she can briefly stand.\nVideo\n\u201cThe steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt this searing pain and thought, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m never going to walk again,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn\u2019t feel he had tried to kill me.\u201d\nEven though their marriage was spiraling apart, Hawke immediately left the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky to fly to his wife\u2019s side.\n\u201cI approached Quentin in very serious terms and told him that he had let Uma down as a director and as a friend,\u201d he told me. He said he told Tarantino, \u201cHey, man, she is a great actress, not a stunt driver, and you know that.\u201d Hawke added that the director \u201cwas very upset with himself and asked for my forgiveness.\u201d\nTwo weeks after the crash, after trying to see the car and footage of the incident, she had her lawyer send a letter to Miramax, summarizing the event and reserving the right to sue.\nMiramax offered to show her the footage if she signed a document \u201creleasing them of any consequences of my future pain and suffering,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThurman says her mind meld with Tarantino was rattled. \u201cWe were in a terrible fight for years,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe had to then go through promoting the movies. It was all very thin ice. We had a fateful fight at Soho House in New York in 2004 and we were shouting at each other because he wouldn\u2019t let me see the footage and he told me that was what they had all decided.\u201d\nNow, so many years after the accident, inspired by the reckoning on violence against women, reliving her own \u201cdehumanization to the point of death\u201d in Mexico, and furious that there have not been more legal repercussions against Weinstein, Thurman says she handed over the result of her own excavations to the police and ramped up the pressure to cajole the crash footage out of Tarantino.\n\u201cQuentin finally atoned by giving it to me after 15 years, right?\u201d she says. \u201cNot that it matters now, with my permanently damaged neck and my screwed-up knees.\u201d\n(Tarantino aficionados spy an echo of Thurman\u2019s crash in his 2007 movie, \u201cDeath Proof,\u201d produced by Weinstein and starring Thurman\u2019s stunt double, Zo\u00eb Bell. Young women, including a blond Rose McGowan, die in myriad ways, including by slamming into a windshield.)\nAs she sits by the fire on a second night when we talk until 3 a.m., tears begin to fall down her cheeks. She brushes them away.\n\u201cWhen they turned on me after the accident,\u201d she says, \u201cI went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool.\u201d\nThurman says that in \u201cKill Bill,\u201d Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.\n\u201cHarvey assaulted me but that didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?\u201d She says she didn\u2019t feel disempowered by any of it. Until the crash.\n\u201cPersonally, it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you \u2018in love\u2019 with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.\u201d",
