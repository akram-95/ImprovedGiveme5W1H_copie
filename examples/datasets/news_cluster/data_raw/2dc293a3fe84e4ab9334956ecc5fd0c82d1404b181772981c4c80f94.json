  "text": "Tarantino says making Thurman perform a car stunt gone wrong is the \"biggest regret\" of his life.\nQuentin Tarantino has finally responded to Uma Thurman\u2019s New York Times profile, in which the actress revealed Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her after the making of \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and spoke about the abusive production of \u201cKill Bill\u201d under his direction. In an extensive interview with Deadline, Tarantino tells all about his version of the events, including the parts of the New York Times story where it mentions he choked and spit on Thurman during takes of \u201cKill Bill.\u201d\nRead More: Uma Thurman Accuses Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Assault: \u2018He Tried to Expose Himself\u2019\nTarantino does not deny spitting on Thurman during a scene in which Michael Madsen\u2019s character spits on The Bride, and he defends his choice since he did trust either Madsen or another crew member to get the job done in a way that would be respectful to Thurman. According to Tarantino, he told Thurman he would only need to do the scene three times max and that the last thing he wanted was for some other person to be spitting on her and messing up, which would force even more takes of the abusive scene.\n\u201cI love [Madsen] he\u2019s a terrific actor, but I didn\u2019t trust him with this kind of intricate work, of nailing this,\u201d Tarantino said of the spit scene. \u201cSo the idea is, I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m taking responsibility. Also, I\u2019m the director, so I can kind of art direct this spit. I know where I want it to land. I\u2019m right next to the camera. So, boom! I do it. Now, if I screw up and I keep missing, once we get to that third one, if she doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore, well then, that\u2019s on me.\u201d\nAs for the scene in which Tarantino was choking Thurman, the director told Deadline it was the actress\u2019 idea. The scene in question features the assassin Gogo (Chiaki Kuryama) throwing her deadly chain around The Bride\u2019s neck and tightening it. Tarantino originally thought he could direct the scene by connecting the chain to a pole in the background that wouldn\u2019t be on film, but he says it was Thurman\u2019s decision to have the chain actually wrap around her neck and have someone pull it.\n\u201cIt was Uma\u2019s suggestion. To just wrap the thing around her neck, and choke her,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cNot forever, not for a long time. But it\u2019s not going to look right. I can act all strangle-ey, but if you want my face to get red and the tears to come to my eye, then you kind of need to choke me. I was the one on the other end of the chain and we kind of only did it for the close ups. And we pulled it off. Now, that was her idea.\u201d\nThurman\u2019s biggest revelation in The Times article concerns a car stunt gone wrong during the final days of filming \u201cKill Bill.\u201d The actress learned that the vehicle being used in the scene was faulty, so she approached Tarantino to tell him she was uncomfortable with driving the car herself.\n\u201cQuentin came in my trailer and didn\u2019t like to hear no, like any director,\u201d Thurman told The New York Times. \u201cHe was furious because I\u2019d cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. He said: \u2018I promise you the car is fine. It\u2019s a straight piece of road.\u2019\u201d\nAccording to Thurman, Tarantino instructed her to \u201chit 40 miles per hour or your hair won\u2019t blow the right way and I\u2019ll make you do it again.\u201d The car ended up veering off the road and crashing into a tree. Thurman sustained injuries she says still haven\u2019t properly healed. Following The Times story, Thurman took to Instagram to say she no longer blames Tarantino for the accident. She said Tarantino \u201cwas deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event.\u201d\nSpeaking to Deadline, Tarantino called the accident \u201cthe biggest regret of my life.\u201d He admitted that he had heard Uma was \u201ctrepidatious about doing the driving shot,\u201d so he decided to try out driving the car himself just to make sure the car was ready to perform during filming. Tarantino says he never viewed the scene as a \u201cstunt.\u201d While he was driving down the straight path of road, he came to the conclusion that performing the driving herself should \u201cbe okay\u201d for Thurman.\n\u201cUma had a license. I knew she was a shaky driver, but she had a license,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cWhen I was all finished [driving], I was very happy, thinking, she can totally do this, it won\u2019t be a problem. I go to Uma\u2019s trailer\u2026I said, \u2018Oh, Uma, it\u2019s just fine. You can totally do this. It\u2019s just a straight line, that\u2019s all it is. You get in the car at [point] number one, and drive to number two and you\u2019re all good.'\u201d\n\u201cUma\u2019s response was, \u2018Okay,'\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause she believed me. Because she trusted me. I told her it would be okay. I told her the road was a straight line. I told her it would be safe. And it wasn\u2019t. I was wrong. I didn\u2019t force her into the car. She got into it because she trusted me. And she believed me.\u201d\nFilming of the scene ended up taking place at the end of the day when the light from the sun was hitting the road differently, which is not something Tarantino thought of could be a problem when he was test driving the car. At the last minute, Tarantino decided to switch the direction Thurman would drive down the road so that he could properly film her.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing on this, but let\u2019s say we were going to do the car from east to west? Could we go from west to east? It didn\u2019t affect the shot,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see how it would affect anything. A straight road is a straight road. We changed our number one, so the car would be driving in the opposite direction from the way I had gone down. And that was the beginning of where the crash happened.\u201d\nBy switching the direction of the driving, the road now contained a small \u201cS\u201d curve. It was here where Thurman hit a rough patch and the car lost control and hit into a tree. Tarantino called watching the accident unfold on set \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d \u201cBeyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it is one of the biggest regrets of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a myriad of reasons.\u201d\nAlthough the crash didn\u2019t permanently ruin their relationship, Tarantino said it broke the trust between them. Thurman had long fought to gain access to the video footage of the crash but was prevented for 15 years by Weinstein, both Tarantino and the actress allege. Weinstein reportedly wanted to prevent Thurman the opportunity to sue the production. Tarantino helped her finally get access to the footage before she sat down with The New York Times.\nTarantino said he was originally supposed to be included in The Times article but was never contacted by the writer Maureen Dowd.\nSaveSave\nSaveSaveSaveSave\nSaveSave\nSaveSave\nSaveSave\nSaveSave",
