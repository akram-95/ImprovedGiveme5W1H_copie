  "text": "SpaceX is all set to launch its most powerful rocket to date in the form of the Falcon Heavy \u2013 and not only that, it's planning a high-stakes triple landing for the core components.\nFalcon Heavy essentially looks like three SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets strapped together. When it launches on Tuesday, Elon Musk\u2019s brainchild project will attempt to land all three of Heavy\u2019s first stage core boosters \u2013 at the same time.\nREAD MORE: Elon Musk's epic montage of explosive SpaceX fails (VIDEO)\n\u201cFollowing booster separation, Falcon Heavy\u2019s two side cores will return to land at SpaceX\u2019s Landing Zones 1 and 2 (LZ-1 & LZ-2) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida,\u201d SpaceX confirmed, as cited by Business Wire.\n\u201cFalcon Heavy\u2019s center core will attempt to land on the \u2018Of Course I Still Love You\u2019 droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean,\u201d the company added. SpaceX has some form in landing the Falcon 9 rockets.\nFalcon 9s have safely returned to Earth, either touching down on land or on robotic drone ships, a total of 21 times so far. As part of it\u2019s reusable rocket remit, SpaceX has reflown boosters six times.\nFalcon Heavy remains go for launch at 1:30pm on Tuesday \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2018\nFalcon Heavy\u2019s inaugural flight will go a step further if all three components manage a safe return. The massive rocket, billed by the company as \u201cthe most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two,\u201d can lift a payload of nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb) \u2013 more than a fully laden 737 aircraft \u2013 into space.\nFor this test mission, the payload will be both lighter and less typical than your average space launch. A red Tesla Roadster, complete with a dummy passenger called Starman, is acting as unconventional ballast on board and is all set to be shot into space.\nA post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 4, 2018 at 9:50pm PST\nHere\u2019s hoping he makes it, though there\u2019s always a chance it could end in a ball of flames just like some of his previous SpaceX missions.",
