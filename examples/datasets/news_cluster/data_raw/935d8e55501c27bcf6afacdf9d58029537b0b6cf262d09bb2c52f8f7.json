Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at Facebook, said in November that the social network was \u201cripping apart the social fabric of how society works.\u201d\nThe new Center for Humane Technology includes an unprecedented alliance of former employees of some of today\u2019s biggest tech companies. Apart from Mr. Harris, the center includes Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager; Lynn Fox, a former Apple and Google communications executive; Dave Morin, a former Facebook executive; Justin Rosenstein, who created Facebook\u2019s Like button and is a co-founder of Asana; Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook; and Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a technologist who studies bots.\nThe group expects its numbers to grow. Its first project to reform the industry will be to introduce a Ledger of Harms \u2014 a website aimed at guiding rank-and-file engineers who are concerned about what they are being asked to build. The site will include data on the health effects of different technologies and ways to make products that are healthier.\nJim Steyer, chief executive and founder of Common Sense, said the Truth About Tech campaign was modeled on antismoking drives and focused on children because of their vulnerability. That may sway tech chief executives to change, he said. Already, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told The Guardian last month that he would not let his nephew on social media, while the Facebook investor Sean Parker also recently said of the social network that \u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201d\nMr. Steyer said, \u201cYou see a degree of hypocrisy with all these guys in Silicon Valley.\u201d\nThe new group also plans to begin lobbying for laws to curtail the power of big tech companies. It will initially focus on two pieces of legislation: a bill being introduced by Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would commission research on technology\u2019s impact on children\u2019s health, and a bill in California by State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat, which would prohibit the use of digital bots without identification.\nMr. McNamee said he had joined the Center for Humane Technology because he was horrified by what he had helped enable as an early Facebook investor.\n\u201cFacebook appeals to your lizard brain \u2014 primarily fear and anger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with smartphones, they\u2019ve got you for every waking moment.\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nHe said the people who made these products could stop them before they did more harm.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for me to correct a wrong,\u201d Mr. McNamee said.",
