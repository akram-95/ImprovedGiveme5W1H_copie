  "text": "next\nprev\nRussia's space experts say they have managed to regain control of Angola's first satellite launched earlier this week.\nThe Russian-built satellite successfully entered a designated orbit after Tuesday's launch from the Baikonur pad in Kazakhstan, but experts couldn't immediately establish contact.\nThe state-run Energia company that built the AngoSat 1 satellite said Friday its engineers have finally established communications with the craft and received data indicating that all its systems are operating properly.\nThe glitch with the Angolan satellite followed a failed launch in November, drawing attention to the Russian space industry's problems.\nAsked about the failures, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that they warrant a thorough analysis of the situation.",
