  "text": "Hawaiian Airlines Flight Takes Off In 2018 But Lands In 2017\nThe flight from Auckland, New Zealand, left on Jan. 1, 2018 but when it landed nine hours later in Honolulu, Hawaii, it was Sun. Dec. 31, 2017.\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\nGood morning. I'm Ailsa Chang with news of a trip back in time. A flight from Auckland, New Zealand, to Hawaii experienced a short delay getting off the ground. The 10-minute hold up meant a Hawaiian Airlines flight left on Jan. 1, 2018. And just about nine hours later, passengers arrive at the gate in Honolulu at 10:15 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2017. No need for a DeLorean like in \"Back To The Future.\" Turns out a flight delay works just fine for time travel. It's MORNING EDITION.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.
