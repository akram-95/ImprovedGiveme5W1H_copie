  "text": "(CNN) Chaos broke out in Nice, France, after a truck plowed through throngs of tourists and locals celebrating Bastille Day on Thursday evening.\nScrambling for safety, the crowd dispersed and took cover in nearby restaurants and hotels. Here are accounts from some of those witnesses:\n'Dallas, now Nice'\nKristen Crouch, visiting from Dallas for a friend's wedding, was among the tourists who fled for their lives shortly after the fireworks display for the Bastille Day celebrations -- France's equivalent to July 4.\n\"I heard like two pops. I thought it was fireworks and then didn't think anything of it but all sudden all these people were running in the opposite direction speaking in French and screaming,\" Crouch told CNN affiliate KTVT.\nShe said she saw dozens of police cars and ambulances.\n\"It's really sad when you've been marked safe twice on Facebook in the last week.\" Dallas woman in Nice speaks @ 10 pic.twitter.com/eoFElv423x \u2014 Jeff Paul (@Jeff_Journalist) July 15, 2016\nAs she and her friends started to realize dozens had been killed, they took cover in a nearby apartment. Crouch had been in Dallas last week when five police officers were shot dead at a protest against police brutality.\n\"It's really sad when you've been marked safe twice on Facebook in the last week. We shouldn't live in a world like that,\" Crouch said.\nShe described it as a \"surreal, unbelievable\" situation.\n'Well planned'\nAndy McArdy works at Le Queenie, a restaurant on the Promenade des Anglais.\n\"It was very well planned,\" he told CNN in a phone call Friday.\n\"They knew that the noise of fireworks would mask the noise of gunfire, so that people would think that they were hearing fireworks, instead of, sadly, live gunfire that killed people.\n\"It happened immediately after the fireworks. The truck appeared on the promenade -- and the promenade was blocked, so he must have broken through the barriers; it was driving on the sea side, and shooting at the people on the sea side. You could hear the pop, pop, pop. There were bodies everywhere.\n\"Everyone came rushing in the restaurant -- about 100 people -- trying to find safe passage; they ended up staying in the building until midnight, when police said it was safe to leave.\n\"It's an extremely eerie atmosphere at the moment, nothing has been cleaned away -- the bodies have been removed, but the debris and the blood are still there. \"\n'No time to react'\nEric Drattell, an American who witnessed the chaotic scene, recalled how he and his wife were having a glass of wine before being startled by the sound of gunfire.\nHe told CNN that after spending time in Paris and Nice during the Euro 2016 soccer tournament which passed off without any incidents, \"terrorism was the furthest thing\" from their minds.\n\"Initially after the attack there was a lot of screaming, people were crying, people of all ages had crowded into the restaurant area,\" he said.\n\"There were about 100 people initially who had jumped down to the beach, which is about 300, 400 meters from the promenade level.\n\"We saw a child stroller or pram that had been run over, and later when we were allowed to go back to our hotel we saw bodies all over the floor and honestly couldn't tell which were adults or children.\"\n'Bodies strewn on street'\nDominique Molina and her husband Tony saw the scene unfold from their hotel balcony, which overlooked the beachfront promenade where the attack took place. Their 14-year-old son was with them.\nShe said it took a few seconds to register that the truck, which she saw veer onto the street at about 25 mph \"barreling people,\" was intentionally mowing down the crowd.\n\"I grabbed my son, and I just felt like shielding him and protecting him from seeing that,\" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\n\"He's really shaken,\" she said. \"People should not see these types of things.\"\nShe said heard the \"banging sounds\" the truck made as it ran over the crowd from the balcony. After the gunfire, she heard shrieking and began to see flocks of people run frantically among fallen bodies.\n\"Within a few moments of the gunfire everything went very quiet, very eerily quiet and then you started hearing wailing and screaming and crying,\" she told Anderson Cooper.\nHer husband Tony said they saw at least 10 dead bodies, strewn on the street.\n\"These bodies kind of sat. It was sad, because there were families just laying down, crying next to these bodies,\" he said.\n\"Then they had to clear the area out. The bodies sat there covered up.\"\nVideo shot by Dominique Molina and posted to Twitter shows the aftermath of the attack.\n'We had to run for our lives'\nPaul DeLane, who's lived in France for 25 years, had just finished watching the fireworks when thousands of people started running in his direction.\n\"My partner took my hand immediately and we started running with everybody and honestly in my head I had no idea what was going on and the music was so loud.\"\nThough he didn't see the truck, Delane did see \"people running and screaming and crying and people carrying their children, and it was just very frightening.\"\n\"We all just knew that we had to run for our lives. Well, that's basically what happened,\" he told CNN\nPhotos: Bastille Day terror: Harrowing images of truck attack in Nice Baby strollers are seen on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, on Friday, July 15.
