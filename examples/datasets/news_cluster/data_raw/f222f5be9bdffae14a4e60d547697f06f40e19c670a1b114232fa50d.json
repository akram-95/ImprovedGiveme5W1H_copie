  "text": "PS4 system update 5.50 is currently in beta, and now the future PlayStation 4 firmware has been fully updated. Sony has now confirmed a list of new features, which include play time management, several user interface changes, the ability to play background music on PS Now, being able to add custom wallpapers via USB, and supersampling for PS4 Pro owners. That\u2019s a lot of changes, and it\u2019s pretty clear now why Sony is currently beta testing it.\nHere\u2019s the full list of new PS4 system update 5.50 features (via the PlayStation Blog):\nPlay Time Management\nWe\u2019re introducing Play Time Management, which will allow family managers (and adult family members who are set as guardians) to manage PS4 playtime for child family members on family on PSN. Managing Playtime is easy; go to Settings > Family Management on your PS4, or log into your PlayStation account on your web browser from your PC or smartphone, to check and manage your child\u2019s playtime each day. If needed, the family manager/guardians can apply playtime restrictions to make sure that the child is only playing for a set amount of time or within set playable hours. Notifications on PS4 will be sent to the child during gameplay so that he or she knows when they should save and quit. The family managers/guardians also have the option to add extra game time via their smartphone or PC. In addition, the family manager/guardians can choose whether or not to automatically log the child out of their PS4 once their playtime is over.\nLibrary UI Updates\n\u2018This PS4\u2019 and Name/Avatar tab\nTwo new tabs are being added to Library to make it easier for you to see which apps you\u2019ve installed and purchased. The \u2018This PS4\u2019 tab lists all the applications that are installed on the PS4 system, and the tab with your name/avatar lists all the apps that you purchased with your PSN ID. This feature also makes it easy to search and find games you\u2019ve already purchased but have not yet installed.\nPS Plus tab\nThis update also adds a new PS Plus tab to the Library, which clarifies what games you own from PS Plus\u2019 Monthly Free Games. If your PS Plus membership is expired, a PS Plus icon with a lock will appear next to your game so you\u2019ll know you cannot play the game until you\u2019ve re-subscribed.\nHide apps\nWe\u2019re adding a function that will allow you to hide certain applications under the \u2018Purchased\u2019 tab in the Library. In \u2018Options,\u2019 you can hide content including betas, trials or demos of games that you probably won\u2019t be going back to.\nQuick Menu Enhancements\nIf you ever want to quickly access specific friends in your custom list, you\u2019ll be able to do so via the pulldown menu under the Friends tab in Quick Menu. You can also see who\u2019s currently online.\nWhenever you\u2019re listening to music on PS4, you\u2019ll be able to access certain shortcuts from the Quick Menu. If you\u2019re using Spotify on PlayStation Music, the \u2018square\u2019 button will serve as the shortcut for volume control. And when you\u2019re on the Media Player or the USB Music Player, \u2018triangle\u2019 will work as the shortcut for play or pause, and the \u2018square\u2019 button as the volume control.\nBackground Music on PS Now\nWith Background Music on PlayStation Now, you\u2019ll be able to listen to your favorite tracks while streaming a game on PS Now. Just keep in mind that, similar to when playing a game locally on PS4, background music may not always be available.\nNotifications Update\nThis update will give you the ability to delete old notifications for better organization and management. Just go to Notifications and press the \u2018triangle\u2019 or \u2018Options\u2019 button to open up a menu that will allow you to select a single or multiple notifications you\u2019d like to delete.\nImport Custom Wallpapers via USB\nLove customizing your PS4 Home Screen? Well, this new update will give you even more options. You can import your own images to PS4 from a USB stick and set it as your wallpaper. You can also zoom and crop your images so they look perfect on your dashboard. Just go to Settings > Themes > Select Theme > Custom > Select Image > USB Storage Device.\nCustomize Tournaments Team Pages\nFollowing the 5.50 update, you\u2019ll be able to customize your Tournaments team page with your own team logo or background that you can import from a USB stick. Represent your team by customizing your team page with something unique and original! To set your logo and background, head over to Events > Teams > select your team > Edit Team Profile.\nSupersampling Mode on PS4 Pro\nPS4 Pro users will see a new \u2018supersampling mode\u2019 under Settings, which enables those with HDTVs (i.e., 1080p or less) to enjoy an enhanced visual experience when playing some PS4 games. With supersampling mode, games that render to a higher resolution when connected to a 4K TV will downscale to match the HDTV \u2013 allowing PS4 Pro owners to leverage the benefits of an image clarity boost even if they don\u2019t own a 4K TV. Certain games already have \u2018supersampling\u2019 benefits as part of their \u2018PS4 Pro Enhanced\u2019 feature set, but this new mode can enhance the experience for those games that don\u2019t already have the feature. Because PS4 Pro\u2019s added power and modes benefit different games in different ways, please note that certain games\u2019 image clarity may not improve with this new feature.",
