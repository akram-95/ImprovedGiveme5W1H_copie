The victim is then asked to send personal information which is used to con them out of their money.\nNeu has allegedly participated in hundreds of scams and has wired money to co-conspirators in Nigeria.\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nSlidell is 33 miles (53 kilometers) northeast of New Orleans.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
