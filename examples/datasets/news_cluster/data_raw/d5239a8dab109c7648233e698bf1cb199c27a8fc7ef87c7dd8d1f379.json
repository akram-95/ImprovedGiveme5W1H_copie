  "text": "At least two people have died in a suicide attack on the German consulate in a city in north Afghanistan.\nA car packed with explosives was rammed into the high outer wall surrounding the consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif.\nAuthorities were investigating if a second car was involved, said a local Nato spokesperson.\nThe Taliban called it a \u201crevenge attack\u201d for US airstrikes in the volatile province of Kunduz earlier this month that left up to 32 civilians dead.\n\u201cThe suicide attacker rammed his explosives-laden car into the wall of German consulate in the city,\u201d local police chief Sayed Kamal Sadat told AFP.\nA huge explosion, followed by sporadic gunfire, reverberated across the usually tranquil city, smashing windows of nearby shops and leaving terrified local residents fleeing for cover.\nAt least two dead bodies and more than 100 wounded people \u2013 including at least 10 children \u2013 had so far been brought to two city hospitals, said local doctor Noor Mohammad Fayez.\nSome of the wounded are in a critical condition, he added.\nAfghanistan: Between Hope and Fear\n16 show all Afghanistan: Between Hope and Fear\n1/16 2001 Afghans at the Killi Faizo refugee camp desperately reach for bags of rice being handed out to the thousands who escaped the bombardment in southern Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom.

A diplomatic source in Berlin said Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had convened a crisis meeting at his ministry.\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the \u201cmartyrdom attack\u201d on the German consulate had left \u201ctens of invaders\u201d dead. The insurgents are routinely known to exaggerate battlefield claims.\nMr Mujahid said the assault was in retaliation for American airstrikes in Kunduz.\nUS forces conceded last week that its air strikes \u201cvery likely\u201d resulted in civilian casualties in Kunduz, pledging a full investigation into the incident.\nThe strikes killed several children, after a Taliban assault left two American soldiers and three Afghan special forces soldiers dead near Kunduz city, and triggered impassioned protests in the city.\nCivilian casualties caused by Nato forces have been one of the most contentious issues in the 15-year campaign against the insurgents, prompting strong public and government criticism.\nAdditional reporting from agencies",
