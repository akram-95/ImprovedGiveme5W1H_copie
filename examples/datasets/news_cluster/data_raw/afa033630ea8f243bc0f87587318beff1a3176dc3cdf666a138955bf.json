The group, which has campaigned within Nigeria and internationally for the release of the students, said it awaits the names of the released girls.\nFighters swapped for schoolgirls\nA Nigerian military source said four detained Boko Haram leaders have been freed in exchange for the release of the schoolgirls.\nThe abduction of the schoolgirls in April 2014 and the government\u2019s failure to quickly free them had caused international outrage and brought Boko Haram, Nigeria\u2019s home-grown militant group, to the world\u2019s attention.\nDozens of the girls escaped on their own, but most remain missing.",
