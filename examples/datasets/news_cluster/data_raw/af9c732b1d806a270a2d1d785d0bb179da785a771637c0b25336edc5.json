  "text": "There is a new no-go term on China\u2019s Web: brother-in-law.\nOver the past few days, as the disclosures from the Panama Papers sent a shiver through the global elite, the search term \u201cbrother-in-law\u201d briefly became a censor-evading path in China.\nThe brother-in-law who can\u2019t be named is none other than Deng Jiagui, a businessman married to President Xi Jinping\u2019s sister. Deng is among a handful of elite Chinese with family ties to at least eight current or former top leaders named in reporting and documents about offshore holdings published this week by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).\n[Is China\u2019s leader losing his grip?]\nIn addition to Deng, the papers note in-law ties to Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, who are on the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member group that ultimately rules China. Also appearing in the leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm is a host of relatives of four former politburo members. A descendant of the late Communist revolutionary Mao Zedong is also named.\nThe Panama Papers consist of 11.5 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. The papers apparently implicate a number of high-profile global figures in potentially illegal financial activities. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\nIt\u2019s all too claustrophobic for China\u2019s leadership, which has moved quickly to censor references to China in the Panama Papers reports \u2014 even though there is no direct evidence of wrongdoing.\nShell companies and offshore accounts \u2014 specialties of the law firm at the center of the leak, Mossack Fonseca \u2014 are technically not prohibited in China and do not specifically point to any illegal or questionable dealings. The law firm has publicly denied any work outside international codes.\n[Corruption runs deep in Chinese system]\nBut for Xi, the princeling son of a revolutionary hero, a president who extols \u201csocialist core values\u201d and has waged a high-profile anti-corruption campaign, all this talk of offshore wealth is clearly uncomfortable.\nSince the news broke Sunday, China\u2019s news-minders have moved quickly to squelch speculation and scrub domestic reports of mentions of China in the Panama Papers reports \u2014 even as they prominently note Russian and Western links to the disclosures.\nMeanwhile, curious Chinese hammered away with Web searches such as \u201cbrother-in-law\u201d in hopes of breaching the Great Firewall with a roundabout query.\n\u201cThe more you try to cover up, the more there will be attention from the public,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based historian and political analyst.\nThis week\u2019s disclosures are a mix of familiar names and new revelations about the apparent wealth of the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cRed Nobility,\u201d a topic that\u2019s particularly sensitive as Xi urges his comrades to tackle the country\u2019s reputation for political payoffs, bribery and other corruption.\n[Chinese anti-graft campaign borrows name from \u2018Terminator\u2019 films]\nIn 2012, a Bloomberg News investigation probed the business dealings of Xi\u2019s sister, Qi Qiao\u00adqiao, and her husband, Deng. The article documented offshore holdings and investments worth hundreds of millions. That report, and a New York Times account of the family wealth of former premier Wen Jiabao, resulted in both publications\u2019 being denied some journalist visas for years.\nThe topic of offshore wealth flashed again in 2014 with the publication of a joint ICIJ and Center for Public Integrity report on 22,000 alleged tax-haven clients from Hong Kong and China. The findings referred to relatives of Wen and Xi and noted Deng\u2019s offshore holdings.\nA woman identified in the Panama Papers, Li Xiaolin, was also named in the earlier report. She is the daughter of Li Peng, the former premier who oversaw the bloody 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square.\nAsked about the article at a Foreign Ministry news conference in 2014, a Chinese government spokesman called the investigation \u201chardly convincing.\u201d The report was blocked, and the Chinese news media did not play it up.\nThis week\u2019s news sheds fresh light on how politically connected Chinese use offshore companies.\n[The mysterious message that led to the Panama Papers leaks]\nAfter Xi\u2019s family, the highest-ranking cadres in the Panama report are Liu Yunshan, China\u2019s propaganda czar, and Zhang Gaoli, the current vice premier. Liu\u2019s daughter-in-law and the son-in-law of Zhang are named as shareholders in companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a well-known tax haven. The islands are also home to a company whose sole director and shareholder was Mao\u2019s grandson-in-law, Chen Dongsheng, according to the ICIJ.\nJasmine Li Zidan, the debutante granddaughter of Jia Qing\u00adlin, a Standing Committee member from 2002 to 2012, has interests in two companies there. In 2010, as a freshman at Stanford University, Li took ownership of an offshore company, Harvest Sun Trading, for a $1 token amount, documents show.\nHarvest Sun and another company were later used to set up two companies in Beijing. Because of that ownership structure, those companies were not listed under Li\u2019s name.\nOther prominent names in the Mossack Fonseca leak include the brother of former vice president Zeng Qinghong and the son of Hu Yaobang, who led the Communist Party from 1982 to 1987 before he was purged.\n[The expanding list of Chinese elite on the Panama Papers]\nSince coming to power in 2012, Xi has waged a public campaign against official corruption, promising to root out both \u201ctigers\u201d (high-level officials) and \u201cflies\u201d (the rank and file) and to hunt wrongdoers who flee overseas. The fruits of this campaign are featured regularly on party-controlled newscasts, and eye-popping tales of official extravagance have long been popular in the party-controlled and private press.\nBut those stories are told on the party\u2019s terms. Members of the ruling classes are purged at times \u2014 a former top military official went down on corruption charges this week \u2014 but the lives and livelihoods of Xi, his relatives and his close allies are generally not discussed.\n\u201cThe average per-capita income in China is still under $10,000, and the leadership doesn\u2019t want it to be known that relatives of senior leaders are millionaires or even billionaires,\" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nEspecially right now. As China\u2019s economy slows, the government is trying to instill faith in what\u2019s to come \u2014 a message that could be undercut by stories about party scions storing wealth elsewhere, Glaser said.\n\u201cThere is suspicion in China, not without foundation, that people who invest or park their money overseas have low confidence in the country\u2019s future,\u201d she said.\nThe latest revelations, while unlikely to topple the powers that be, will certainly fuel cynicism and distrust in some quarters.\nBefore the censors swept in, users on Zhihu, a Chinese question-and-answer site similar to Quora, were having a carefully worded field day with the reports on Mossack Fonseca.\nAsked one post that was circulated widely before being scrubbed: \u201cWhat should I do if my brother-in-law does something wrong?\u201d\nAna Swanson in Washington and Gu Jinglu and Xu Jing in Beijing contributed to this report.",
