(Photo: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports)\nThe Chicago Cubs are World Series champions.\nThat's a sentence that not many expected to be able to accurately write. But on Wednesday, it happened. The Cubs edged out the Indians 8-7 in 10 innings to take Game 7 and win their first World Series since 1908.\nNow, 108 years means a lot of excitement. This was how the sports world reacted.\nKris Bryant smiling as he fields and throws for the final out is the greatest. pic.twitter.com/8bAU1ayKbJ \u2014 Mike Cole (@MikeColeNESN) November 3, 2016\n12:47 a.m. Nov. 3, 2016. The end of 108 years of heartbreak on the North Side of Chicago. The ghosts & the goats can go home now. \u2014 Jayson Stark (@jaysonst) November 3, 2016\nCongratulations to the 2016 Chicago Cubs...once in a lifetime...or two lifetimes. \u2014 Michael Wilbon (@RealMikeWilbon) November 3, 2016\nSteve Bartman needs to go streaking down Waveland Ave in just his headphones tonight. \u2014 Brett Anderson (@BrettAnderson35) November 3, 2016\nKnew it would feel amazing if it happened. Didn't think I'd be sobbing like a goddamn child. Truly thought I'd never see this. What a ride. \u2014 Mark Titus (@clubtrillion) November 3, 2016\nFor the first time ever, the Wrigley Field marquee reads: \"World Series Champions.\" pic.twitter.com/fWfJSLRueE \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 3, 2016\nGreat way to end the baseball season...congrats to the cubbies...city of Chicago is the place to be tonight \u2014 Christian Yelich (@ChristianYelich) November 3, 2016\nZobrist has gotta be pumped he can finally get rid of that Saturn \u2014 Phil Hughes (@PJHughes45) November 3, 2016\nPlane taking off. Let's go Cubbies!!!! \u2014 DWade (@DwyaneWade) November 3, 2016\nEvery curse has its moment when it must end, or when at the very least adult rational sportscasters must stop acting like curses exist. \u2014 Linda Holmes (@nprmonkeysee) November 3, 2016\nI want Steve Bartman to throw out the first pitch for Cubs Opening Day in 2017. \u2014 Richard Deitsch (@richarddeitsch) November 3, 2016\nCongrats to the newest World Champions, the Chicago @Cubs, from the Kansas City Royals! pic.twitter.com/X8ox2wMl8H \u2014 Kansas City Royals (@Royals) November 3, 2016\n\"Kyrie not gone save y'all this time\" pic.twitter.com/rkkgeaAmVI \u2014 Pap\u00ec (@Kxngsosa) November 3, 2016\nThis is a great great sight pic.twitter.com/nMeCRC0600 \u2014 Steve DiMeglio (@Steve_DiMeglio) November 3, 2016\nSteve Bartman, all is forgiven. \u2014 David Burge (@iowahawkblog) November 3, 2016\nThis is surreal. Thousands of Cubs fans singing \"Go Cubs Go\" in someone else's ballpark 300 miles from Wrigley. \u2014 Jayson Stark (@jaysonst) November 3, 2016\nBill Murray just achieved total consciousness. \u2014 Don Jozwiak (@djoz) November 3, 2016\nRead or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/sports-world-reacts-chicago-cubs-winning-world-series-twitter/",
