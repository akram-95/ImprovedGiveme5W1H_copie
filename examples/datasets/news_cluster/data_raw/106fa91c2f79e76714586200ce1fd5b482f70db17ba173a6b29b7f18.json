  "text": "CLOSE CEO of Tesla and Space X, Elon Musk gave us all a sneak peek at his Falcon Heavy rocket that is expected to take flight in January 2018. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk said this midnight cherry Tesla Roadster will launch atop the debut flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket, targeted for January 2018 from Kennedy Space Center. (Photo: SpaceX via Florida Today)\nMELBOURNE, Fla. \u2014 Can you feel it?\nSpaceX has revealed pictures of a Tesla Roadster sports car mounted inside the nose cone that will launch atop the Falcon Heavy \u2014 the world\u2019s new most powerful rocket \u2014 as soon as next month.\n\u201cTest flights of new rockets usually contain mass simulators in the form of concrete or steel blocks,\u201d Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, said Friday on Instagram. \u201cThat seemed extremely boring. ... We decided to send something unusual, something that made us feel.\u201d\nMore: Tesla's make-or-break year? 2018 will test Elon Musk\nMusk says the midnight cherry red Roadster (his own, according to previous posts) is bound for the Red Planet \u201con a billion year elliptic Mars orbit.\u201d\nTranslation: The convertible will end up in an orbit around the sun that takes it \u201cnear Mars,\u201d said Phil Plait, aka \"The Bad Astronomer.\"\n\u201cThis is a low-energy orbit; that is, it takes the least amount of energy to put something in this orbit from Earth,\u201d Plait wrote in SYFY Wire. \u201cThat makes sense for a first flight.\u201d\nThe new pictures show the Roadster\u2019s nose angled upward on its launch mount, as if it is launching off a ramp.\nMusk has said there is plenty of risk involved in the Heavy\u2019s demonstration flight from Kennedy Space Center\u2019s historic pad 39A, site of NASA\u2019s Apollo moon launches.\nMore: Yowza! Mysterious bright light stuns Californians after SpaceX rocket launch\n\u201cWill be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn\u2019t blow up on ascent,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cGuaranteed to be exciting, one way or another.\u201d\nThe Roadster\u2019s nose is angled upward on its launch mount, as if it is launching off a ramp. (Photo: SpaceX via Florida Today)\nThe pictures further dispelled any notions Musk was kidding when on Dec. 1 he first announced plans to launch the car, whose radio will play David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity. SpaceX said shortly afterward that it was no joke.\nThe company said it is open to ideas from the public on additional payloads that could fly.\nAs anticipation about the test launch builds, SpaceX fans are eager to see a test-firing of the 27 Merlin engines powering the Heavy\u2019s three side-by-side boosters, capable of producing up to 5.1 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.\nMore: Photos: See the world's most powerful rocket \u2014 all 27 engines \u2014 before it launches\nThat\u2019s about twice as powerful as the next most powerful rocket available today, United Launch Alliance\u2019s Delta IV Heavy. NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket, which is targeting a first launch by mid-2020, will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust, the most ever.\nThe static fire test was possible before the end of the year, but SpaceX has not confirmed any plans.\nAnother dramatic aspect of the demonstration flight is the potential to see all three of the Heavy\u2019s boosters land \u2014 the two side stages back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the middle one on a \u201cdrone ship\u201d floating in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe three boosters making up the first stage of SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket, seen inside the company's hangar at Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A in Cape Canaveral. (Photo: SpaceX via Florida Today)\nThe side boosters are what SpaceX calls \u201cflight proven,\u201d having previously launched missions as single-stick Falcon 9 rockets.\nNo date is set for the Falcon Heavy launch. SpaceX already has as many as three Falcon 9 launches scheduled in January \u2014 two from Cape Canaveral and one from California.\nThe first of those could launch a classified U.S. government satellite from the Cape as soon as Jan. 4. The others are targeted for late in the month.\nSpaceX on Friday completed its best year yet with a sunset launch of Iridium satellites from California. The spectacular sight of the rocket\u2019s plume glowing over Los Angeles sparked some speculation about UFOs.\nSpaceX in 2017 launched 18 missions, including five on recycled Falcon boosters, and landed 14 first-stage boosters.\nMore: After the Elon Musk show, Tesla questions linger\nMore launches may be on tap in 2018 now that the company has both its Florida pads online at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\nThe latter reopened in mid-December after more than a year of repairs and upgrades after a September 2016 Falcon 9 explosion on the pad at Launch Complex 40.\nSpaceX and Boeing both say the New Year could include the first launch of astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011.\nFollow James Dean on Twitter: @flatoday_jdean\nMore: Tesla flying car?
