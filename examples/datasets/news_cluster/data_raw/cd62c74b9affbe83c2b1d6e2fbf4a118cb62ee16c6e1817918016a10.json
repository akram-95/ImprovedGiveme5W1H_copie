Le\u2019Veon Bell added a 10-yard scoring run late in the third quarter, and the rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster made it 34-6 with an 18-yard touchdown grab in the fourth.\nBell finished with 14 carries for 69 yards, and Smith-Schuster had six receptions for 75 yards.\nQuarterback T.J. Yates was 7 of 16 for 83 yards and a touchdown for the Texans, who lost their fifth straight game and for the eighth time in nine games. Yates made his second straight start since Tom Savage sustained a concussion. Yates left Monday\u2019s game briefly to be evaluated for a possible concussion, and his replacement, Taylor Heinicke, sustained a concussion on his only full possession.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nRoethlisberger was replaced by the backup Landry Jones with about six minutes remaining and the game well in hand.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.
