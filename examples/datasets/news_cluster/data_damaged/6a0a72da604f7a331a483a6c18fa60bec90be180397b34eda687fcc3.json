  "text": "more-in\nA special zoo response team killed a 17-year-old gorilla that grabbed and dragged a three-year-old boy who fell into the gorilla exhibit moat.\nAuthorities said the three-year-old boy, who fell 10 to 12 feet, was picked up out of the moat and dragged by the gorilla for about 10 minutes. He was later taken to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center.\nDirector Thane Maynard said the zoo\u2019s dangerous animal response team that practices for such incidents decided the boy was in \u201ca life-threatening situation\u201d and that they needed to put down the 400-pound-plus male gorilla named Harambe.\n\u201cThey made a tough choice and they made the right choice because they saved that little boy\u2019s life,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cIt could have been very bad.\u201d\nMr. Maynard said he hadn\u2019t talked with the boy\u2019s parents yet. He said it was the first time that the team had killed a zoo animal in such an emergency situation, and he called it \u201ca very sad day\u201d at the zoo. The lowland gorilla is an endangered species.",
