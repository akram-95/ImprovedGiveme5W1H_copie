I can't even put it into words. It's an unbelievable team to be a part of.\nCarl Edwards Jr celebrates the Cubs' World Series victory (Getty)\n\"Every guy on this team roots for each other, takes care of each other and picks each other up and that's what we did during that rain delay.\"\nRizzo added: \"It's the best game I've ever been a part of. What a team. We started this year as heavy favourites and we went wire to wire all year as the best team in baseball.\nChicago fans celebrate after the Cubs win the World Series (Getty)\n\"The Indians did one heck of a job but this is the best feeling in the world.\n\"We're world champions.
