  "text": "SONY has released a new firmware update for the PS4 family of consoles, shortly after its massive 5.0 update dropped.\nSONY PS4 Update 5.50: Sony release new system upgrade - here\u2019s what it does\nPS4 Update 5.50 - UPDATE 1: Sony has now released the patch notes on what you can expect from the update as it rolls out for beta users. We've published the full list here, but you can also check out the new features in our gallery below. The PlayStation 4 system's next major system software update 5.50 (codenamed KEIJI), will introduce Play Time Management, Library plus Quick Menu updates and much more besides. The update will also improve the image quality of some games on a TV with 2K resolution or lower - which is interesting for players using a regular old PS4 model, or the newer PS4 Pro. There's no timescale on when non-beta members will receive this update, but it usually isn't too long after the patch first gets rolled out. We'll keep you updated as soon as it's announced.\nPS4 update version 5.50 changes: supersampling, library hide options, custom wallpapers SONY has detailed the changes coming in the PS4's 5.50 update, including supersampling, library hide options and custom wallpapers. 1 / 18\nOriginal Story: Sony's newest PS4 patch was released on Friday and while this is only for Beta testers for the time being, it does give us some clues as to one or two cool little features that are surely in the pipeline for the next big PlayStation 4 firmware update. Though this is still subject to change, it looks as though the headline feature of the next big console update will be system-wide supersampling. Sony's own in-game message explained that this will, \u201cimprove the image quality of some games on a TV with 2K resolution or lower.\u201d So, if you've upgraded to the PS4 Pro but haven't had the cash flow to fork out for a shiny new TV - sticking to your standard high definition screen - then the console will effectively shrink down a 4K image to suit your 1080p telly. Whilst a step in the right direction, it's also worth noting that this feature has some funky side effects. Namely, it's possible that you'll see a change in frame rate. Equally, Sony doesn't guarantee that all games will see a marked improvement. \"Results may differ depending on the games. In some games, image quality may not improve, or the frame rate may change.\" reads the official statement from the Beta. Those with access to the beta are still fishing through for what else is new, but it appears that you can also hide items in the Library - so you can not ditch demos and betas - as well as the ability to delete notifications. Unfortunately, the long requested feature of changing your PSN username still does not appear to be on the cards for Sony's next big update. If it's been a while since you updated your PS4 console and you're yet to update to 5.00, keep reading and we'll recap the newest available features for your console.\nPlayStation 4 games deals - February 2018: DOOM, CoD, Persona, The Last Guardian and more Some of the best deals available on PS4 in February 2018 1 / 10\nThe biggest part of the 5.00 update was directed mostly at PS4 Pro users, who following the update could stream their content at 1080p and 60FPS. Of course, streaming at this quality will require you to have a pretty strong internet connection. The new patch will also let you manage your Friends List with new, more in-depth tools. You'll be able to split your list into a variety of separate lists - so you can see all your friends that are playing any specific game at any one time. On top of this, you can also send invites asking players and Friends to come online at a certain time and disable notifications whilst watching TV or film apps. As previously mentioned, Parental Controls have also seen a huge overhaul - they're now called 'Family on PSN' and contain more tools to control the content you can access on the console. One user is the Family Manager and they can then set up accounts and appoint them as a parent/guardian, adult, or child. Parents or guardians can then restrict child accounts \u201cuse of online features and communication with other players\u201d. They can also set restrictions for games, restrict the use of the internet browser, and set spending limits for PlayStation Store.
