The agency says one MTA worker is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nThere were no passengers on the trains, and MTA officials say the accident is having no impact on subway service during the morning commute.\nFire department officials say firefighters removed one person from the Manhattan side of a tunnel under the East River after the accident occurred around 5:10 a.m.\nMedia outlets report that the trains collided in the 53rd Street tunnel that carries passenger trains between Manhattan and Queens. That stretch of tunnel has been undergoing repairs.",
