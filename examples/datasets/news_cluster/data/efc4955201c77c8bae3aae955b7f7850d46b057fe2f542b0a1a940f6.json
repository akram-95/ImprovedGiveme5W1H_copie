It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it. The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge. The device is described as something that can be 'folded or unfolded semi automatically.' A complex hinge allows the device to be folded in half When folded, the device resembles a wallet, patent drawings have shown\nThe Galaxy S9 is rumoured to be getting a camera capable of shooting incredible slow motion video.\nAccording to Tech Radar, 'industry sources' claim Samsung is working on a rear camera that can shoot at 1,000 frames/second.\nIf this is true, the camera would be better than anything on the market yet.\nWhile a launch date for the Galaxy S9 is yet to be revealed, rumours suggest that the device could be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress, which is in Barcelona from 26 February \u2013 1 March 2018. Pictured is the Galaxy S8, which launched in April 2017\nOther new rumoured features include a modular design, with magnets that let users attach accessories, including zoom lenses and battery packs.\nEldar Murtazin told Tech Radar that the S9 is 'likely' to have modular capabilities, although he added that 'this option is not approved.'\nSamsung will reportedly also integrate its own neural engine into the Galaxy S9, according to the Korean Herald, which writes that this technology could allow for speech recognition and improved AI capabilities.\nThe S8 currently features an iris-scanner, but rumours suggest that this technology will be replaced with facial recognition - similar to the Face ID introduced in the iPhone X by Apple.\nIce Universe tweeted: 'I think the Galaxy S9 still has a 3.5mm headphone jack.' This clashes with other rumours by TechDroider, who posted a sketch of the possible phone yesterday, and suggested the headphone jack would go.\nThere is also expected to be two versions of the S9 being developed - a 5.8 inch S9 and 6.2 inch S9 Plus.\nWhile a launch date for the Galaxy S9 is yet to be revealed, rumours suggest that the device could be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress, which is in Barcelona from 26 February \u2013 1 March 2018.\nThe price for the Galaxy S9 remains unknown, but based on the price of the Galaxy S8, it is likely to cost between \u00a3689 and \u00a3779 ($916 to $1,036).",
