  "text": "On late Saturday morning, a bird flew out of the cold Detroit sky, across an airfield and into the cockpit of a jetliner bound south for Atlanta.\nSome believe it was a sparrow. Some, a hummingbird. A Delta Air Lines spokesman referred to it only as a \u201cstowaway\u201d \u2014 and, in any case, it would be a long delay before anyone on Flight 1943 could catch the thing to get a look at it.\nShane Perry, a minister with a connection and a speech to make, was waiting to board when he saw the pilot walk off the jet bridge and whisper something to the ticket agent.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018In my 18 years of doing this, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen this,\u2019 \u201d Perry told The Washington Post. \u201cThere\u2019s a bird in the cockpit.\u201d\nThe ticket agent laughed at this. It seemed funny to Perry, too, at that point. He boarded the plane with the other passengers and watched as yellow-vested workers rummaged through the cockpit.\nThey didn\u2019t find the bird in the first few minutes, or the next few. The pilot stood in the aisle, hands in pockets, and watched like everyone else.\nAn hour later, Perry was still sitting in a grounded airplane, watching winter birds flit around outside his window while the stowaway stayed hidden in the cockpit.\nThere was some talk that morning of moving everyone to a different plane, but, eventually, the pilot\u2019s voice came over the intercom and announced that the bird must have left.\n\u201cThe explanation was the bird had apparently flown out of some type of hatch under the plane, which seemed strange to me,\u201d Perry said.\nHe recalled the pilot telling the passengers: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take off, but if I hear any chirping in the cockpit, I\u2019ll turn around.\u201d\n\u201cI took that as a joke,\u201d Perry said.\n[A woman ordered canaries to brighten her home. The USPS delivered a box of \u2018bird carnage.\u2019]\nNow accounts begin to differ again.\nPerry doesn\u2019t think they were in the air more than five minutes before the bird made its second appearance. The Delta spokesman described the time as \u201cshortly after takeoff.\u201d\nFor Brian Buonassissi, a traveling DJ in the middle of an exhausting New York-to-Detroit-to-Atlanta-to-Florida connection, it felt as if they\u2019d been flying for an hour before the captain came back on the intercom and said: \u201cThe bird is back.\u201d\n\u201cThe bird is flying around the cockpit,\u201d he announced, as Perry recalled it.\nThis is pretty much what passengers saw of the search for the bird. (Courtesy of Brian Buonassissi)\nIf the hunt for this elusive bird \u2014 which Buonassissi thought the pilot said was a hummingbird, though Perry was not sure \u2014 had begun in the morning as a comedy, it seemed less funny now at midday, thousands of feet above the ground.\nSeated close behind the cockpit door, Perry imagined what might happen if the bird flapped into an instrument panel.\nBack in Aisle 14, Buonassissi heard his seatmates break into a chorus of groans, astonished laughs and \u201cwhat did he say\u201ds at the announcement of the bird\u2019s return and what it meant for the 100-odd humans on board.\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the Captain made the decision to return to Detroit to avoid a potential distraction during flight,\u201d the Delta spokesman said in a statement.\nBuonassissi thinks the bird, like everyone on the flight, made it halfway to Georgia before the plane turned back. A flight tracker shows the plane made a big loop around Detroit and landed back where it started, shortly after noon.\nAnd then the men in yellow vests came back on board, and the search resumed.\n[How a wife\u2019s suspicions of infidelity diverted an entire flight]\nBy now, people were in danger of missing their connections. So Buonassissi and a couple of other passengers walked back to the gate to try to find other flights.\nPerry stayed in his seat and watched a somewhat disgruntled-looking pilot watch the workers search for the bird.\nBuonassissi got back on the plane, having decided that there was no faster way than this to get to his DJ gig.\nA few more minutes passed, and then he saw it:\nA worker came out of the cockpit. In his arms was a towel. In the towel was a very small bird that had managed to ground a 55-ton flying machine.\nThe plane took off again in the early afternoon. Perry made it to his speech, and Buonassissi made his connection.\n\u201cThe bird was safely removed and set free,\u201d the spokesman wrote.\nIf it ever gets to Georgia, we won\u2019t know.\nRead more:\nBritish Airways apologizes after passengers say bedbug-infested flight left them \u2018covered in bites\u2019\nA man got a middle seat on a 13-hour flight.
