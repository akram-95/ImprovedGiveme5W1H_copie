With more than 5 million pounds of liftoff thrust the Heavy will be capable of lifting super-size satellites into orbit and sending spacecraft to the moon, Mars and beyond. (SpaceX via AP) (Associated Press)\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s hot new monster rocket makes its launch debut this week, blasting off from the same pad that hoisted men to the moon a half-century ago.\nThe Falcon Heavy won\u2019t surpass NASA\u2019s Saturn V moon rocket, still all-time king of the launch circuit. It won\u2019t even approach the liftoff might of NASA\u2019s space shuttles.\nBut when it departs on its first test flight \u2014 as early as Tuesday \u2014 the Heavy with its three boosters and 27 engines will be the most powerful working rocket out there today, by a factor of two. Picture SpaceX\u2019s frequent-flyer Falcon 9 and its single booster and then times that by three; the Heavy\u2019s three first-stage boosters are strapped side by side by side.\nThe Heavy represents serious business for the private space company founded 16 years ago by Elon Musk. With more than 5 million pounds of liftoff thrust \u2014 equivalent to 18 747s jetliners \u2014 the Heavy will be capable of lifting supersize satellites into orbit and sending spacecraft to the moon, Mars and beyond.\nUsing another airplane analogy, SpaceX boasts a Heavy could lift a 737 into orbit, passengers, luggage and all.\nThe company already has some Heavy customers lined up, including the U.S. Air Force.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it fly and to see it fly again and again,\u201d said the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s Alan Stern. He\u2019s the lead scientist for NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft which made an unprecedented flyby of Pluto and is now headed to an even smaller, icy world on the fringes of the solar system.\nCape Canaveral hasn\u2019t seen this kind of rocket mania since the last space shuttle flight in 2011. Huge crowds are expected for the afternoon launch from Kennedy Space Center. Visitor center tickets for the best up-close viewing, called \u201cFeel the Heat\u201d and \u201cClosest Package,\u201d sold out quickly.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about what would be the biggest and largest operational launch vehicle in the world, that adds another dimension of excitement,\u201d said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who used to work for SpaceX and the Obama administration.\nThe Heavy is capable of delivering, in one fell swoop, 140,660 pounds (63,800 kilograms) of cargo to low-Earth orbit, nearly 60,000 pounds (26,700 kilograms) to high-Earth orbit, 37,000 pounds (16,800 kilograms) to Mars, or 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) to Pluto.\nBut for this inaugural flight, the rocket will carry up Musk\u2019s cherry-red Tesla Roadster. In addition to SpaceX, he runs the electric car maker Tesla.\n\u201cRed car for a red planet,\u201d Musk tweeted in December, when announcing the surprise cargo.\nFresh-off-the-drawing-board rockets typically carry steel or concrete blocks in place of true cargo.\n\u201cThat seemed extremely boring,\u201d Musk explained.\nNASA officials said the Falcon Heavy is just the latest evidence of the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s transformation into a multi-user spaceport, a turnaround after decades of space shuttles taking center stage.\nA variety of rockets will be needed \u2014 besides NASA\u2019s still-under-construction Space Launch System megarocket \u2014 as astronauts venture out into the solar system, said Kennedy\u2019s director of center planning and development, Tom Engler. Blue Origin, led by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, for instance, is developing a big, reusable orbital-class rocket named New Glenn after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn.\nCocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik, a banker by day, noted that jobs are making a big comeback, with so many private rocketeers and other aerospace businesses hitting town. The area suffered thousands of layoffs when the 30-year space shuttle program ended.\n\u201cWe are not only back, but the region is much more diversified,\u201d Malik said. \u201cWe are becoming a high-tech hub.\u201d\nStern sees the Heavy opening the door to more exploration, both human and robotic, given its heft and cost savings. SpaceX\u2019s launch failures of Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 showed the company has \u201ca very strong backbone.\u201d While Falcon 1 was completely on the SpaceX tab, Falcon 9 benefited from the company\u2019s contracts with NASA for space station shipments.\nThis persistence resulted in SpaceX becoming, in 2010, the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and then safely guide it back to Earth, something only large governments had accomplished. Two years later, SpaceX became the first commercial supplier of the International Space Station. Now the company is aiming for the first commercial crew launch.\nAt the heart of SpaceX\u2019s cost savings is its rocket-recycling campaign. Two of the Heavy\u2019s first-stage boosters are repeats, having flown on Falcon 9s. The company will attempt to recover all three boosters; the two old boosters will aim for side-by-side vertical touchdowns at Cape Canaveral, while the new, beefed-up center core will attempt to land on a floating ocean platform.\nRocket makers typically discard their leftover boosters in the ocean. Now those boosters often come back and land, at least when it\u2019s SpaceX, complete with sonic booms just like the old shuttle days.\nUnlike most rockets out there, the Falcon Heavy receives no government funding. The Mars-obsessed Musk has taken it upon himself and his California-based aerospace company to bankroll the hulking rocket. At a sticker price of $90 million, the Heavy is a relative bargain. NASA\u2019s bigger and more powerful SLS is expected to exceed $1 billion a flight.\nMusk upped the ante by putting his Tesla atop this first Heavy; he\u2019s been warning for months the rocket might not make it higher than the launch tower.\nIf the flight succeeds, it will be the first true automobile hurled into space. It\u2019s destined for a perpetual orbit around the sun that will swing out as far as Mars. The car\u2019s soundtrack will be playing David Bowie\u2019s \u201cSpace Oddity.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a catchy way to get attention,\u201d said Stern while driving his blue Tesla Model S in Boulder, Colorado, last week.\nMusk is already looking ahead to an even bigger SpaceX rocket that would phase out both the Falcon 9 and Heavy.\nRetired NASA historian and Smithsonian curator Roger Launius cautioned SpaceX has \u201ca long history of overpromising,\u201d although eventually succeeding. The Heavy\u2019s debut, for example, has been delayed for years. Musk has acknowledged the Heavy proved harder to build than anticipated.\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of more capacity to get off this planet, so I cheer when anyone has a successful new rocket,\u201d Launius wrote in an email.\nHe promised to be \u201cproperly congratulatory\u201d if and when success comes.\n___\nOnline:\nSpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
