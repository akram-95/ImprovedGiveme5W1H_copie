  "text": "FILE - In this May 18, 2017 file photo, actress Uma Thurman poses for photographers during the photo call for the Un Certain Regard jury at the 70th international film festival, Cannes, southern France. Thurman has accused embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing himself upon her sexually and director Quentin Tarantino of making her perform a dangerous car stunt that injured her. Thurman is quoted in The New York Times on Saturday, Feb. 3, 2018, as saying Weinstein attacked her in London. She says he pushed her down and tried to shove himself on her and expose himself. (Alastair Grant/Associated Press)\nNEW YORK \u2014 Actress Uma Thurman, in long-awaited remarks, has accused embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing himself upon her sexually and accused \u201cKill Bill\u201d director Quentin Tarantino of making her perform a dangerous car stunt that injured her.\nThurman\u2019s allegations against Weinstein had been widely anticipated since she hinted late last year that she had a story to tell about the beleaguered movie mogul, who has been accused of sexual misconduct against many women, but wanted to wait until she was less angry. Her story came in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.\n\u201cI used the word \u2018anger,\u2019 but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,\u201d Thurman said in the Times article. \u201cI was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.\u201d\nThurman told Dowd that an early encounter with Weinstein in a Paris hotel room in the 1990s ended with him suddenly appearing in a bathrobe and leading her to a steam room but that the first \u201cattack\u201d \u2014 the word appears in quotes \u2014 happened later in London.\n\u201cHe pushed me down,\u201d she said. \u201cHe tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn\u2019t actually put his back into it and force me. You\u2019re like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard.\u201d\nLater, she alleged, she arranged a meeting with Weinstein and warned him: \u201cIf you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.\u201d\nThe Times article says Thurman\u2019s memory of the Weinstein encounter stops there, but it quotes a friend who was waiting downstairs as saying Thurman emerged from an elevator disheveled and shaking.\n\u201cHer eyes were crazy, and she was totally out of control,\u201d said the friend, Ilona Herman.\nWhen Thurman was able to talk again, Herman said, she revealed that Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, had threatened to derail her career.\nA representative for Thurman, Leslie Sloane, responded to an Associated Press request for more details on all the encounters by saying only: \u201cThe article speaks for itself.\u201d\nWeinstein, the executive producer of award-winning movies including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck\u2019s \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and Tarantino\u2019s \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d acknowledged making an \u201cawkward pass\u201d at Thurman but denied physical assault and emphasized a longstanding professional relationship with her.\n\u201cMr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologized and deeply regrets,\u201d his representative Holly Baird said in an emailed statement. \u201cHowever, her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue.\u201d\nThe statement questioned why Thurman waited 25 years to make her allegations public and said numerous photographs show Thurman and Weinstein had a \u201cstrong relationship\u201d for many years.\nThurman, one of the stars of \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d also was quoted as saying that just before shooting began on Tarantino\u2019s \u201cKill Bill: Vol. 1,\u201d which came out in 2003, she told Tarantino about Weinstein and he confronted the mogul, leading him to apologize.\nBut Thurman also described a harrowing onset episode on location in Mexico in which Tarantino ignored her expressed fears of driving a car that she had been warned might be faulty.\nTarantino persuaded her to do it, the article said, quoting him as saying, \u201cHit 40 miles per hour or your hair won\u2019t blow the right way and I\u2019ll make you do it again.\u201d\nVideo accompanying the article online shows Thurman struggling to control the car and crashing into a tree.\nThurman said in the article \u201cthat was a deathbox that I was in,\u201d the seat \u201cwasn\u2019t screwed down properly\u201d and the sand road \u201cwas not a straight road.\u201d She said that after the crash she left a hospital in a neck brace with damaged knees and a concussion.\nTarantino\u2019s representatives did not respond to the AP\u2019s request for comment. The Times also did not get a response, according to the article.\nWeinstein, who has been accused by scores of women of sexual assault or harassment, was fired by the film company he founded with his brother and was expelled from Hollywood\u2019s movie academy. He has apologized for causing \u201ca lot of pain\u201d with \u201cthe way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past\u201d but has denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex.\u201d\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
