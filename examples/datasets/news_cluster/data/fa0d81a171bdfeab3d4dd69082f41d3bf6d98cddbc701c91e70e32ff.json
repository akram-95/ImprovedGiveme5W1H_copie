  "text": "\u201cNeil Portnow\u2019s comments are not a reflection of being \u2018inarticulate\u2019 in a single interview. They are, unfortunately, emblematic of a much larger issue with the Naras organization as a whole on the broader set of inclusion issues across all demographics,\u201d the women wrote, referring to the academy by an acronym for its legal name, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\nFurther underscoring their letter\u2019s weight, the women note that they also write on behalf of their companies, which include the music world\u2019s three dominant conglomerates.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nMr. Portnow responded on Monday afternoon with a brief statement: \u201cWe appreciate the points raised in this letter and welcome the opportunity to work with these executives to address the issues of inclusion, representation, fairness, and diversity in our community. As we establish the details around our recently announced task force, we will seek their input and guidance.\u201d\nIn the days leading up this year\u2019s awards, gender became a much more hotly debated topic for the industry than perhaps ever before.\nThe rapid spread of the #MeToo movement in Hollywood, media and politics put a spotlight on the music world\u2019s relative quiet on the issue. An academic report highlighted the poor record of gender diversity in music and at the Grammys, where for the last six years only 9.3 percent of nominees have been women. This year, only one woman won a solo award during the televised ceremony.\nAnd Lorde, the sole female nominee for album of the year, was not offered a performance slot of her own. In a gesture interpreted as protest, Lorde stitched a provocative poem by the artist Jenny Holzer into the back of her red dress: \u201cRejoice! Our times are intolerable,\u201d the poem began. \u201cTake courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best.\u201d\nWhen asked after the awards whether it was a mistake not to offer Lorde a solo spot, Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can really deal with everybody.\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nA day after Mr. Portnow made his \u201cstep up\u201d remark, he issued another statement saying that the music world \u201cmust welcome, mentor and empower\u201d women. But many women found that comment condescending and noted that it contained no apology.\nLast week, as criticism of Mr. Portnow and the academy grew louder, the organization announced the creation of a task force to review its work, with the goal to \u201covercome the explicit barriers and unconscious biases that impede female advancement in the music community.\u201d\nThe executives\u2019 letter calls on the Academy\u2019s board to ensure a thorough review by the task force, and adds, \u201cas senior music executives with true commitment to the welfare of the organization and the music community, we hereby put ourselves forward for service.\u201d",
