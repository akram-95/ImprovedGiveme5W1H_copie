  "text": "YOU get the feeling that whatever Lewis Hamilton tries, this is just simply not going to be his year.\nDespite driving at his brilliant best to win the Brazilian Grand Prix for the first time in his career, his title looks destined to be crossing the Mercedes garage floor to Nico Rosberg.\nGetty Images Lewis Hamilton celebrates victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix\nGetty Images But the World Championship is likely to be Nico Rosberg's in Abu Dhabi\nGetty Images Romain Grosjean's car was towed after crashing out in the formation lap of a chaotic race\nHamilton, reigned supreme in the rain-hit incident packed race that saw TWO red flags and FIVE safety cars deployed.\nIt was the 52nd victory of his F1 career and moves him to second in the all-time winners' list behind Michael Schumacher.\nBut the looming figure of Rosberg stood next to him on the podium in second place means the German can win the title with a top-three finish in Abu Dhabi, irrespective of where Hamilton finishes.\nHamilton's third win in a row cannot stop the tide. The damage was done early in the season with woeful reliability problems ensuring that it goes down to the final race.\nNevertheless, the Brit has promised to give it his best shot in the desert.\nHe said: \"I am hunting and all I can do is do what I can. I am going to give it my all in Abu Dhabi.\n\"I need to keep on doing. It is going to be hard to beat Nico but it does not mean I cannot win the race.\n\"I am going to take this energy and speed and try to push as hard as I can to win that race.\"\nGetty Images Hamilton was left furious after the race was twice red flagged\nRosberg was given a huge helping hand thanks to a Red Bull strategy blunder to pit the swashbuckling Max Verstappen for intermediate tyres.\nThe sensational Dutch driver made a string of sensational overtakes that livened up this race but after overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and Rosberg, was inexplicably called in for fresh rubber.\nThe gambled backfired and a subsequent stop dropped him down to 15th place -- incredibly he battled back to third.\nHamilton was also left furious after race bosses put the brakes on his charge to the chequered flag on two occasions.\nAt one point, the Brit had a stonking lead that was almost 26 second over his rival but that was wiped out when the retiring Felipe Massa crashed out, forcing out the safety car.\nGetty Images Red Bull's Max Verstappen was the outstanding driver at Interlagos\nThen there was Race Director Charlie Whiting's inexplicable call to stop the race, despite a number of drivers, including Hamilton, calling for him to allow them to race.\nHamilton vented his frustration over the team's radio towards Whiting -- who was blasted by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the last race.\nAt the second red flag, Hamilton groaned: \"The track is fine! It is not even that wet now. This is not extreme wet conditions this is normal.\"\nThe spectators at Interlagos also greeted Whiting's decision with jeers.\nAs it happened, Whiting's decision made no difference to Hamilton, thought it could have forced Rosberg into making a mistake that would have put him out of the race.\nNo wonder then that the German was content with second place that leaves him with a 12 point lead in the championship with one to go.\nLewis Hamilton talks about how good the team at Mercedes are\nHe added: \"It did not go my way. Lewis did a great job but I can live with second. I was hoping for a win for second is OK.\"\nHamilton's win was good but the real star was Verstappen. The 19-year-old was belittled by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last week after he contacted his father, Jos, to warn him about his son meddling in the title race.\nYet he answered the criticism perfectly with a thrilling performance, including one of the saves of the season, impressing Verstappen senior in the process.\nJos Verstappen said: \"I must say he surprised me today. I've seen many races he did, and today it was incredible.\n\"He did himself a big pleasure today. They didn't have the right strategy, unlucky with weather, but it was good for Formula One.\"\nAP:Associated Press Massa gave the home crowd an emotional farewell in his last ever Brazilian Grand Prix\nDRIVER OF THE DAY: Max Verstappen stole the show with an amazing drive.\nMOVE OF THR RACE: Verstappen pulled off a blinder on Kimi Raikkonen at turn one on lap eight.\nMILKFLOAT: Jenson Button had a miserable afternoon in his McLaren.\nMISTAKE OF THE RACE: Romain Grosjean never even made it to the grid after crashing out on the formation lap.\nTIMELINE\nLap 14 Marcus Ericsson has a big smash in his Sauber and the safety car is deployed\nLap 20 Kimi Raikkonen has a huge smash and the race is red flagged.\nLap 29 Drivers are left furious as Charlie Whiting stops the race with another red flag.\nLap 44 Verstappen is called in for intermediate tyres -- a costly decision from Red Bull.\nLap 48 Felipe Massa has a smash and the safety car is deployed. It wipes out Hamilton's lead.\nLap 69 Verstappen passes Sergio Perez to take an impressive third place.",
