  "text": "Photo\nWe may have reached peak superhero. Only a few weeks after DC united six of its biggest crime-fighters in \u201cJustice League,\u201d Marvel has struck back by releasing the trailer for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d featuring more than 20 superhuman characters, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), all of whom have headlined their own stand-alone films.\nThere\u2019s also Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Captain America (Chris Evans), who ditched his trademark accessory at the end of \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d in 2016. \u201cGet this man a shield!\u201d Black Panther growls.\nWorlds collide as the Avengers meet another Marvel franchise, the Guardians of the Galaxy, led by Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). \u201cWho the hell are you guys?\u201d asks Mr. Hemsworth\u2019s Norse god, still missing the eye he lost in \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d but not his newfound sense of humor.\nThe legions team up to fight Thanos, an interstellar tyrant on a mission to collect the six Infinity Stones, which will make him omnipotent. He\u2019s voiced by Josh Brolin, who\u2019ll embody another Marvel figure, Cable, in the forthcoming \u201cDeadpool 2.\u201d Apparently, Hollywood is running out of stars to play all these mutants and super villains and has started to recycle.\n\u201cThis does put a smile on my face,\u201d Thanos declares of his quest, and Disney hopes audiences will be equally happy when \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d reaches theaters on May 4. A sequel is already set for May 3, 2019. It appears the Marvel universe is infinite.",
