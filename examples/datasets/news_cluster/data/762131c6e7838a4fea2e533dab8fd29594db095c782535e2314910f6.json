  "text": "Two days ago, SpaceX CEO and Tesla founder Elon Musk unveiled plans to launch his \"midnight cherry Tesla Roadster\" into space as part of the maiden voyage of the company's Falcon Heavy rocket in January.\nThe planned trajectory: a \"billion year elliptic Mars orbit.\" The soundtrack: David Bowie's \"Space Oddity.\"\nOn Friday, Musk revealed the setup in a photo slideshow posted to Instagram. The Roadster appears bright red in the center of SpaceX's slate grey rocket, called Falcon Heavy.\nMusk's SpaceX venture, alongside Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic enterprise and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, is one of a few private companies committed to exploring travel to the Moon and Mars. The Falcon Heavy rocket is powerful enough to launch a fully booked 737 jet into orbit, and is designed to carry human cargo into space.\nThe mission is seen as a precursor to sending humans to Mars.\nThis article originally appeared on CNET.",
