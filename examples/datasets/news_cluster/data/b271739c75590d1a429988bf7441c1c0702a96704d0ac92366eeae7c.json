  "text": "This Dec. 28, 2017 photo made available by SpaceX shows a Falcon Heavy rocket in Cape Canaveral, Fla. With more than 5 million pounds of liftoff thrust the Heavy will be capable of lifting super-size satellites into orbit and sending spacecraft to the moon, Mars and beyond. (SpaceX via AP) (Associated Press)\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 SpaceX is bucking decades of launch tradition for the first test flight of its new megarocket.\nThe Falcon Heavy is set to become the world\u2019s most powerful rocket in use today when it blasts off from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. None of the usual, no-big-deal-if-it\u2019s-destroyed launch ballast \u2014 like steel or concrete slabs, or mundane experiments \u2014 for this curtain raiser.\nInstead, the rocket will be hauling a red sports convertible with a space-suited dummy at the wheel and David Bowie\u2019s \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d on the soundtrack. It\u2019s the inspiration of Elon Musk, the high-tech, science fiction-loving maverick who heads SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.\nMore about the Tuesday afternoon\u2019s planned launch:\n___\nROCKET STATS:\nThe Falcon Heavy has three first-stage boosters, strapped together with 27 engines in all. Stretching 40 feet (12 meters) at the base and standing 230 feet (70 meters) tall, the Heavy is a triple dose of the Falcon 9, the company\u2019s frequent flyer with just a single booster. At liftoff, the Heavy packs about 5 million pounds of thrust. That\u2019s more liftoff punch than any other rocket currently operating in the world \u2014 by a factor of two \u2014 but less than NASA\u2019s old space shuttles and Saturn V moon rockets. Two of the Heavy\u2019s boosters are recycled; they have flown on previous Falcon 9 launches. Once spent, they will aim for side-by-side vertical touchdowns at Cape Canaveral. The brand new, center core will attempt to land on an ocean barge.\nCAR STATS:\nSpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk also runs the electric car maker Tesla. So in a bit of cross-marketing, he\u2019s put his own cherry-red Tesla Roadster on the Heavy\u2019s inaugural flight. It is one of the car company\u2019s original Roadsters. The flying convertible has a space-suited-dummy at the wheel and David Bowie\u2019s \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d on the soundtrack. No car has ever rocketed into space before, if you don\u2019t count NASA\u2019s Apollo-era moon buggies, still parked on the lunar surface. The Federal Aviation Administration had to sign off on the Heavy-Tesla combo. It\u2019s at the top of the rocket, enclosed for liftoff. The protective cover will drop away, allowing the car to travel on its way.\nDESTINATION:\nSpaceX is targeting a long, oval orbit around the sun for the Roadster that will take the car as far out as Mars, and have it making laps for a billion years. Musk has Mars directly in his long-range sights. He\u2019s intent on establishing a city on the red planet, with hordes of Earthlings and building materials flying there on a super-extra-mega SpaceX rocket that is still pretty much on the drawing boards.\nHISTORIC DEPARTURE POINT:\nThe Falcon Heavy is flying from the same launch pad used by NASA to send men to the moon. SpaceX leases Launch Complex 39A from NASA. Not only did LC-39A, as it\u2019s known, serve as the departure point for all the Apollo moonshots from 1968 to 1972, it was the scene for most of the space shuttle liftoffs. It\u2019s location at Kennedy Space Center keeps people at least three miles away, a distance determined by NASA in the 1960s to be safe just in case the Saturn V exploded on the pad.\nCOMPETITION: Blue Origin, an aerospace company run by another billionaire, is developing a large orbital-class rocket that promises to give Heavy an out-of-this-world run for its money. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the force behind Blue Origin, offered Musk \u201cbest of luck\u201d Monday. \u201cHoping for a beautiful, nominal flight!\u201d Bezos wrote via Twitter. In the language of rocket scientists, \u201cnominal\u201d means the rocket behaves and the cargo reaches its target. NASA, meanwhile, is sinking billions of dollars into a massive new rocket called the Space Launch System, or SLS, that\u2019s meant to return astronauts to the moon and also get them one day to Mars.\nFUTURE FLIGHTS: SpaceX already has customers lined up for the Falcon Heavy. The rocket is designed to hoist supersize satellites as well as equipment or people to the moon, Mars or other far-flung points. The private company\u2019s online flight manifest shows the U.S. Air Force as already signed up.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
