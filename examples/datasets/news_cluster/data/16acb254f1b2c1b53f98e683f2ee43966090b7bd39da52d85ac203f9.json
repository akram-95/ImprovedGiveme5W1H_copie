  "text": "The controversial secure messaging app Telegram was temporarily banned from the App Store by Apple.\nTelegram, which was recently singled out by Theresa May as a platform for terrorists, was removed suddenly from Apple's online store.\nTelegram founder Pavel Durov said he hoped to have the app reinstated by Apple. Both Telegram and a newer version of the app, Telegram X were removed from the App Store.\n\"We were alerted by Apple that inappropriate content was made available to our users and both apps were taken off the App Store,\" Durov said on Twitter. \"Once we have protections in place we expect the apps to be back on the App Store.\"\nThe removal suggests Telegram may have breached Apple's content guidelines for the store. Apple's guidelines for iOS apps say that exclusively pornographic apps or apps which allow abusive content \"do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice\". Apple has been contacted for comment on why the app was removed.",
