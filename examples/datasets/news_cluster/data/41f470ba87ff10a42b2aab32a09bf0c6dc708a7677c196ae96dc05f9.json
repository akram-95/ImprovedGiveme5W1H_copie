  "text": "New images of Samsung\u2019s next big smartphone release, the Galaxy S9, have leaked online.\nThe pictures, from case maker Olixar, were posted on retailer Mobile Fun\u2019s website.\nThe handset hasn't been announced by Samsung yet\nShowing the S9 and S9+ in protective phone cases, the pictures seem to confirm a number of early rumours concerning the phone\u2019s upcoming features.\nThat includes a dual camera on the larger S9+, and the fact the divisive back-mounted fingerprint scanner appears to have moved to a more central position.\nPeople put off by Apple\u2019s decision to ditch the headphone jack will be happy to hear that both S9 handsets appear to have kept the 3.5mm connection, as well as the large 18:9 bezel-less screen.\nCORE OF THE PROBLEM?
