  "text": "This photo released by Costa Rica\u2019s Public Safety Ministry shows smoke rising from the site of a plane crash in Punta Islita, Guanacaste, Costa Rica, Sunday, Dec. 31, 2017. A government statement says there were 10 foreigners and two Costa Rican crew members aboard the plane belonging to Nature Air, which had taken off nearby. (Costa Rica\u2019s Public Safety Ministry via AP) ( /Associated Press)\nSAN JOSE, Costa Rica \u2014 Costa Rican investigators said Monday that strong winds or mechanical problems most likely caused a charter aircraft to crash in woods, killing two crewmembers and 10 U.S. citizens, including families from New York and Florida.\nThe families from the New York City suburb of Scarsdale and from Belleair, Florida, accounted for nine of the dead and were part of a tour organized by Berkeley, California-based Backroads. Their American guide was the 10th U.S. victim.\nMichael Soto, deputy director of Costa Rica\u2019s Judicial Investigation agency, said strong winds were reported Sunday in the area of the crash and were being looked at as a possible factor in the crash of the Nature Air flight in Guanacaste.\n\u201cNo possibility can be left out for certain,\u201d Soto said. \u201cWe have two aspects: The principle one would be some weather condition and if there was a mechanical issue.\u201d\nSoto said authorities would begin identifying the remains through DNA testing and dental records Tuesday. Forensic workers recovered the bodies from the wooded site Sunday night.\nA family in the suburbs of New York City said five of the dead were relatives on vacation. They identified them as Bruce and Irene Steinberg and their sons Matthew, William and Zachary, all of Scarsdale.\n\u201cWe are in utter shock and disbelief right now,\u201d Bruce Steinberg\u2019s sister, Tamara Steinberg Jacobson, wrote on Facebook.\nRabbi Jonathan Blake of the Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale said in a statement posted on the temple\u2019s Facebook page and emailed to The Associated Press that the Steinbergs were involved in philanthropy and local Jewish groups. \u201cThis tragedy hits our community very hard,\u201d Blake wrote.\nIn St. Petersburg, Florida, Rabbi Jacob Luski of Congregation B\u2019nai Israel said victims\u2019 relatives had informed him that four members of his congregation were also on the plane.\n\u201cIt is a tragedy that the Drs. Mitchell Weiss and Leslie Weiss and their two children, Hannah and Ari, died in that terrible crash,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were a wonderful family who will be missed.\u201d\nThe Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, where both the Weiss parents practiced mourned their loss in a statement Monday.\n\u201cWe were deeply grieved this morning to learn of the deaths of two beloved members of our team - Drs. Mitchell and Leslie Weiss,\u201d Kris Hoce, president of Morton Plant Hospital, said in the statement. \u201cTheir lives and medical skills have touched so many in and around our community, and we are forever grateful to them. Our sympathies go out to their extended family and many friends who are also trying to process this tragic news.\u201d\nThe hospital said Mitchell Weiss was a vascular and interventional radiologist and Leslie Weiss was a pediatrician.\nTheir 19-year-old daughter was earning a joint degree at Columbia University and List College, the undergraduate school of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. List College Dean Shuly Rubin Schwartz told the Daily News of New York that Weiss had emerged as a student leader and ardent environmental activist.\n\u201cShe was driving by a real sense of social justice,\u201d Schwartz said.\nIn a statement, Backroads spokeswoman Liz Einbinder said their employee on the flight was Amanda Geissler, a native of Thorp, Wisconsin.\n\u201cAboard the flight were nine Backroads guests, a Backroads Trip Leader and two flight crew members,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA second Nature Air flight carrying Backroads guests and another Trip Leader arrived safely in San Jose.\u201d\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by this tragedy,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.\nMark Noll, women\u2019s basketball coach at the University of Dubuque, said Geissler played point guard for the University of Wisconsin-Stout when he coached there and he last saw her around Thanksgiving.\n\u201cShe was home for like 18 hours, and her and her sister came to the tournament,\u201d Noll recalled Monday. \u201cThey knew I was playing and came to watch Stout and see me.\u201d\n\u201cAmanda was a sweetheart, a great player,\u201d Noll said.\nAt a news conference Sunday, Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica Civil Aviation, said the Nature Air charter crashed shortly after taking off from Punta Islita on a planned flight to the capital of San Jose.\nCubillo identified the pilot as Juan Manuel Retana and described him as very experienced. Former Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla said via Twitter that Retana was her cousin. The co-pilot was identified as Emma Ramos.\nCubillo said the plane flew from San Jose without passengers on Sunday morning, but was unable to land at Punta Islita because of high winds and diverted to Tambor. When the winds decreased, it landed at Punta Islita without problems, he said.\nIt took off from Punta Islita with the crew and 10 passengers at 12:10 p.m. and crashed about 10 minutes later. Winds of 20 knots or 23 mph were reported at the time, Cubillo said.\nNature Air did not respond to phone and email messages.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Doug Feinberg in New York, Jennifer Kay in Miami Beach, Florida, and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
