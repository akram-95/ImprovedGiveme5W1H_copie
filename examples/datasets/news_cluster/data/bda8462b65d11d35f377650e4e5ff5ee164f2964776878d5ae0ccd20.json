  "text": "Pieces weighing up to 100kg could make it to the surface, says expert, when out-of-control 8.5-tonne laboratory breaks apart in the atmosphere\nAn 8.5-tonne Chinese space station has accelerated its out-of-control descent towards Earth and is expected to crash to the surface within a few months.\nThe Tiangong-1 or \u201cHeavenly Palace\u201d lab was launched in 2011 and described as a \u201cpotent political symbol\u201d of China, part of an ambitious scientific push to turn China into a space superpower.\nIt was used for both manned and unmanned missions and visited by China\u2019s first female astronaut, Liu Yang, in 2012.\nBut in 2016, after months of speculation, Chinese officials confirmed they had lost control of the space station and it would crash to Earth in 2017 or 2018. China\u2019s space agency has since notified the UN that it expects Tiangong-1 to come down between October 2017 and April 2018.\nSince then the station\u2019s orbit has been steadily decaying. In recent weeks it has dipped into more dense reaches of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and started falling faster.\n\u201cNow that [its] perigee is below 300km and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of decay is getting higher,\u201d said Jonathan McDowell, a renowned astrophysicist from Harvard University and a space industry enthusiast.\n\u201cI expect it will come down a few months from now \u2013 late 2017 or early 2018.\u201d\nAlthough much of the craft is expected to burn up in the atmosphere, McDowell says some parts might still weigh up to 100kg when they crash into the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe chance that anyone will be harmed by the debris is considered remote but China told the United Nations \u201cCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\u201d in May that it would carefully monitor the craft\u2019s descent and inform the United Nations when it begins its final plunge.\nPredicting where it is going to come down would be impossible even in the days ahead of its landing, McDowell said.\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t steer these things,\u201d he said in 2016. \u201cEven a couple of days before it re-enters we probably won\u2019t know better than six or seven hours, plus or minus, when it\u2019s going to come down. Not knowing when it\u2019s going to come down translates as not knowing where it\u2019s going to come down.\u201d\nMcDowell said a slight change in atmospheric conditions could nudge the landing site \u201cfrom one continent to the next\u201d.\nThere have been many uncontrolled re-entries of larger spacecraft and none have ever been reported to have caused injuries to people.\nIn 1991 the Soviet Union\u2019s 20-tonne Salyut 7 space station crashed to Earth while still docked to another 20-tonne spacecraft called Cosmos 1686. They broke up over Argentina, scattering debris over the town of Capit\u00e1n Berm\u00fadez.\nNasa\u2019s enormous 77-tonne Skylab space station came hurtling to Earth in an almost completely uncontrolled descent in 1979, with some large pieces landing outside Perth in Western Australia.",
