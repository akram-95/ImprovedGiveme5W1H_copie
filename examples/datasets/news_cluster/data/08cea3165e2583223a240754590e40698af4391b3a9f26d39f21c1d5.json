North Korea launched a long-range rocket carrying what it has said is a satellite. (Reuters)\nThe trail of a flying object after it soared into the air above North Korean territory is seen from the Chinese border city of Dandong on Feb. 7, around 8:34 a.m. local time. North Korea launched a long-range rocket carrying what it has said is a satellite. (Reuters)\nNorth Korea on Sunday declared that it had successfully put an \u201cearth observation satellite\u201d into orbit under the direct orders of leader Kim Jong Un, and said it planned to launch \u201cmany more.\u201d\nBoth the South Korean defense ministry and the Pentagon said that the rocket, launched at 9 a.m. North Korean time from a launch pad near the Chinese border, appeared to have successfully reached space.\nThe United States, Japan and South Korea immediately condemned the launch, a move widely seen as another step toward North Korea mastering the technology for making a missile capable of striking the mainland United States. The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting for later Sunday to discuss how to respond to the country\u2019s latest provocation.\nBut North Korea gloated about its most recent advance into space. It said it that it had fired a Kwangmyongsong-4 (the name translates as \u201clode star\u201d), a newer-model satellite than the one launched three years ago and one that it said was equipped with devices for Earth measurement and communication.\n\u201cToday\u2019s success is a proud result of scientific achievement and an exercise of our legitimate right to space,\u201d Ri Chun Hee, North Korea's most famous newsreader, who was brought out of retirement to announce last month\u2019s nuclear test, declared in a special broadcast from Pyongyang following the launch.\nAn image from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency shows the launch of Kwangmyong 4 from an undisclosed location. (KCNS via KNS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\u201cThe success of Kwangmyongsong-4 launch is a groundbreaking event. The National Aerospace Development Administration plans to launch many more satellites following our national policy of focusing on the importance of science and technology,\u201d she said.\nKim, the 33-year-old third-generation leader of North Korea, personally signed the order to launch on Saturday, Ri said. The satellite entered orbit after nine minutes and 46 seconds, she said in the broadcast on Korean Central Television.\nThe launch took place half an hour before the Republican presidential debate started, and candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) both urged China to get tough.\n[North Korea announces plan to launch rocket carrying observation satellite]\nThe rocket launch was expected \u2014 Pyongyang had given warnings to maritime and airspace authorities, and analysts had detected movement at its launch site \u2014 but coming just a month after a nuclear test, it nevertheless showed Kim\u2019s continued willingness to defy the international community.\nThe rocket was projected to fly down South Korea\u2019s west coast, with the first stage expected to splash down near the southern island of Jeju, while the second stage was forecast to go over the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa and in the sea east of the Philippines. Television stations in Japan and South Korea showed footage of the rocket flying through the sky.\nThe rocket went missing from South Korean military radar in the sea near Jeju Island at 9:36 a.m., said defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun, but the Japanese government said that it passed over the southern islands of Okinawa at about 9:41 a.m. There were no reports of any debris falling on land.\n\u201cWe can definitely say that this was an attempted space launch,\u201d said Melissa Hanham, a nuclear expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\nNorth Korea previously fired a Kwangmyongsong-3 on an \u00adUnha-3 (\u201cgalaxy\u201d) missile into orbit in December 2012, the month that North Korea marked the first anniversary of the death of Kim Jong Il, the current leader\u2019s father. Kim\u2019s regime had said it would launch the same kind of satellite into orbit between Feb. 7 and Feb. 14, and the launch came a few hours after that window began. Sunday\u2019s launch also coincides with another key date: North Korea\u2019s celebration of Kim Jong Il\u2019s birthday, Feb. 16.\nNorth Korea has said the launches were of satellites intended for scientific purposes, but analysts and many governments see this as a disguised missile test. North Korea has successfully launched short- and medium-range missiles but has been working to develop a reliable long-range intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States.\n\u201cThis kind of rocket is designed as a space launch vehicle. Before we can consider it an intercontinental ballistic missile, there are a number of modifications that have to be made,\u201d Hanham said. A space rocket goes into the atmosphere to launch a satellite into orbit, but an intercontinental ballistic missile needs to return to Earth from the atmosphere to reach its target \u2014 and deliver a warhead.\nJim Walsh, a research associate in the Security Studies Program at MIT, said that even though most of North Korea\u2019s rocket and missile tests had been failures and Pyongyang was still using liquid-launched rockets, a technology now considered \u201carchaic\u201d everywhere else, there was still reason for concern.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not making progress. The more tests they do, the more they learn, and they\u2019re beavering away trying to improve their technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it also means that at some level, they\u2019re still able to evade sanctions.\u201d\nNevertheless, the international community immediately resumed calls for North Korea to face strong punishment for its actions through more sanctions.\nA spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the launch \u201cdeeply deplorable\u201d and exhorted North Korea \u201cto halt its provocative actions and return to compliance with its international obligations.\u201d Both South Korean President Park \u00adGeun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called emergency meetings of their national security councils, during which both said they could \u201cnot accept\u201d such a provocation.\nFrom Washington, Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, said that the launch using ballistic missile technology, following so closely after North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test, \u201crepresents yet another destabilizing and provocative action and is a flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u201d\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests \u2014 including the security of some of our closest allies \u2014 and undermine peace and security in the broader region,\u201d she said in a statement.\n[China backs U.N. move to denounce North Korea over nuclear test]\nRice also reiterated calls \u2014 mainly directed at China, North Korea\u2019s closest ally and a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council \u2014 for the international community to \u201cstand together and demonstrate to North Korea that its reckless actions must have serious consequences.\u201d\nBut China does not seem particularly keen to crack down on its neighbor. A commentary run by the state-run Xinhua news agency immediately after the launch said: \u201cAmid criticism and condemnation, what should be borne in mind is that negotiations are the only viable solution to the predicament on the Korean Peninsula, as China has repeatedly pointed out.\u201d\nA series of U.N. resolutions has prohibited North Korea from carrying out nuclear or ballistic missile tests, but Kim\u2019s regime has shown little regard for these orders.\nYoongjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this report.",
