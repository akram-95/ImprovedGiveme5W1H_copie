(Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times)\nPaul Simon will undertake what is being billed as his farewell tour, which will begin May 16 in Vancouver, B.C., and including two nights at the Hollywood Bowl on May 22 and 23, bringing to an end a touring career that has spanned more than 50 years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered what it would feel like to reach the point where I'd consider bringing my performing career to a natural end,\u201d Simon, 76, said in a statement. \u201cNow I know: it feels a little unsettling, a touch exhilarating and something of a relief.\n\u201cI love making music,\u201d he added, \u201cmy voice is still strong, and my band is a tight, extraordinary group of gifted musicians. I think about music constantly. I am very grateful for a fulfilling career and, of course, most of all to the audiences who heard something in my music that touched their hearts.\u201d",
