(Feb. 6) AP\nMichael Sheen and Sarah Silverman in 2016. (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)\nSarah Silverman is taking a page out of Gwyneth Paltrow's book.\nThe comedian, 47, tweeted Monday that she \"consciously uncoupled\" from Michael Sheen, 49, ending their four-year-long relationship, over the holidays, borrowing Paltrow's famous breakup language.\n\"No fight,\" Silverman wrote on Twitter, attributing their split to their transatlantic long-distance relationship, with Sheen based in the U.K. and Silverman living in the U.S. \"We just live in different countries and it got hard.\"\nSilverman was first spotted with Sheen, best known for roles in Masters of Sex and Frost/Nixon, in February 2014. Prior to getting together, Silverman had dated Jimmy Kimmel, while Sheen had previously been linked to Rachel McAdams and co-parents his daughter Lily with his ex Kate Beckinsale.\nIn an interview with Kimmel last year, whom she dated on-and-off between 2002 and 2009, Silverman described Sheen's decision to move from Los Angeles to the U.K. to be closer to his daughter.\n\u201cHis daughter turned 18, he wanted to go home,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was here to be near his daughter, now she\u2019s off, she\u2019s going to start her own life...\u201cSo he\u2019s there a lot, and then we just long for each other and we see each other and we love each other.\"\nUSA TODAY's request for comment was not immediately returned.\nThe great @michaelsheen & I consciously uncoupled over Christmas. I mean, not \u201cover Christmas\u201d - like that wasn\u2019t the fight that ended it. No fight. We just live in different countries & it got hard. Felt we should just tell y\u2019all so u stop askin, \u201cHow\u2019s Michael/How\u2019s Sarah?\u201d \u2014 Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 5, 2018\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nICgD6",
