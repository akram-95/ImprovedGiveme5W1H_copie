  "text": "ERIE, Pa. \u2014 A Pennsylvania woman says she went online to check her electric bill and was stunned at the amount \u2014 more than $284 billion.\nThe Erie Times-News reports that Mary Horomanski said her eyes \u201cjust about popped out\u201d of her head when she saw the amount. She suspected that her family had put up their Christmas lights wrong.\nThe silver lining was that she didn\u2019t have to pay the full amount until November 2018 \u2014 only a $28,156 minimum payment was due for December.\nHoromanski\u2019s son contacted Penelac, her electric provider, who confirmed the error. Parent company First Energy said a decimal point was accidentally moved. Her new amount was quickly corrected to $284.46.\n___\nInformation from: Erie Times-News, http://www.goerie.com\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
