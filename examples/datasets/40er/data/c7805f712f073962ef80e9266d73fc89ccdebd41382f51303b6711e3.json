  "text": "You can\u2019t blame Mary Horomanski for getting a little charged up when she saw her electric bill earlier this month.\nWhen the Erie, Pennsylvania, resident checked how much she owed the electric company online, she was met with a bill for a whopping $284 billion.\nYeah, you read that right.\n\u201cMy eyes just about popped out of my head,\u201d the 58-year-old Horomanski told the Erie Times-News. \u201cWe had put up Christmas lights and I wondered if we had put them up wrong.\u201d\nOn the bright side, she had a full year to pay the entire $284 billion. Her minimum payment would be a mere $28,156, according to The Associated Press.\nFor some reason, Horomanski suspected there might have been a billing error, which was confirmed when her son called electricity provider Penelec.\nTurns out, she only owed $284.46 \u2015 still high, but much more manageable.\nMark Durbin, a spokesman for Penelec\u2019s parent company First Energy, said he has never seen a bill for billions of dollars, but told the Erie Times-News the company appreciates Horomanski\u2019s \u201dwillingness to reach out to us about the mistake.\u201d\nThe multibillion-dollar bill did inspire Horomanski to add an item to her Christmas list.\n\u201cI told [my son] I want a heart monitor,\u201d she told the paper.\nAccidentally high bills are a shocking part of modern life.\nIn August 2012, a British woman on vacation in South Wales bought a cheap mobile phone because her own cell couldn\u2019t pick up the local signal.\nThanks to a technical glitch, she ended up being slapped with a bill for more than $42,000.\nIn July 2012, a bank error caused a Nashville, Tennessee, man to be charged $84,522.54 for a $30 tank of gas.\nGood thing he saved the receipt.",
