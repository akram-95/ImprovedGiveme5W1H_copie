(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nLate last month, Equifax secured control over 138 domains mimicking a website that the company launched in September in the wake of its massive data breach.\nSubject to a cybersquatting complaint, the domains were originally purchased through GoDaddy by a Hong Kong company called China Capital Investment Limited. Even now, the domains redirect to placeholder pages full of ads labeled \u201cIdentity Theft Protection\u201d and \u201cProtect My Credit\u201d that link to commercial products such as Lifelock.\nScreenshot: \u201cequifaxsecutiry.com\u201d\nThis summer, after learning that criminal hackers had pilfered the personal and financial data of roughly 145 million Americans, Equifax slowly began the process of exposing its customers to even further harm, included by redirecting victims to a malware-laden website.\nAdvertisement\nBut the complaint against China Capital Investment Limited shows that Equifax was aware that its decision to direct victims to a domain\u2014equifaxsecurity2017.com\u2014independent of its existing Equifax.com website likely subjected the consumers to new threats.\nThe credit reporting agency launched the website solely to manage the fallout stemming from the breach, which was born of faulty security practices. The decision drew immediate concern from the infosec community, with many researchers noting\u2014correctly\u2014how easily it would be for almost anyone to clone the site using a lookalike domain.\nAnd it turns out, that happened immediately. According to a complaint Equifax filed on September 27th with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), China Capital Investment began purchasing lookalike domains within 24 hours of Equifax announcing the breach.\nBelow is small sample of the contested domains.\nIt\u2019s easy to see how consumers might\u2019ve been duped\u2014thanks largely to Equifax\u2019s decision not to place advice to breach victims on its own website. Many of the domains contain simple typos and are clearly aimed at taking advantage of consumers.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the WIPO, China Capital Investment never challenged the complaint. It wasn\u2019t the only entity to purchase an Equifax-lookalike domain, either.\nFor instance, to draw attention to Equifax\u2019s folly, developer Nick Sweeting secured the domain \u201csecurityequifax2017.com\u201d and launched a website mocking the credit reporting agency. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,\u201d Sweeting told Gizmodo in September.\nIn a now-deleted tweet, the official Equifax Twitter account even directed consumers to Sweening\u2019s site, which contained in a the phrase: \u201cWhy Did Equifax Use A Domain That\u2019s So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?\u201d Sweeting said Tuesday that he has retained control over the domain, but that the site is now blacklisted by the Google Safe Browsing list. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty useless right now,\u201d he said.\nIn September, when Equifax first noticed that dozens of websites had been launched targeting its customers, it should\u2019ve backtracked and directed breach victims to a reputable website, like Equifax.com. But for whatever reason the company repeatedly ignored warnings about its decision to launch equifaxsecurity2017.com.\nUltimately, that decision may have exposed US consumers to scams and phishing attacks, further imperiling their personal and financial data.\nGizmodo reached out to Equifax for comment about the domains, but did not receive a response.\nUpdate, Nov. 15, 4pm: Equifax sent Gizmodo the following statement:",
